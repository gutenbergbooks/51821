<p class="screenonly">To avoid duplication, the page numbering in the publisher's Book
Catalog at the back of the book has a suffix C added, so that for

<h3>PREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is a singular fact, that, notwithstanding
the enormous popularity enjoyed by
Hogarth in the minds of English people,
no perfectly popular edition has been hitherto
brought before the public. Were a foreigner to ask
an ordinary Briton who was the most thoroughly
national painter in the roll of English artists, the
answer would be undoubtedly William Hogarth;
but the chances are that our countryman would
not have at command a tangible proof that his
statement was correct. Such editions as have
hitherto appeared have been either expensive or
unsatisfactory,&mdash;even the handsome and costly
volume by Nichols is far from complete. To sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>ply
the want, the present issue has been projected.
The illustrative text of Ireland&mdash;undoubtedly the
best in existence&mdash;has been given in full, and is
supplemented by addenda from the works of Nichols.
The three volumes form certainly the most complete
gallery of Hogarth's drawings yet given to the
public. The rapid progress of science has provided
means by which the pictures have been reduced from
their original size to the compact form of this page;
while, at the same time, the most perfect truthfulness
has been preserved.</p>

<p>Hogarth is essentially English&mdash;brave, straight-forward,
manly; never pandering to fashion or fancy.
When he had to deal with sin and misery, he met
them full in the face, bating no whit of their repulsiveness;
and in all his works, wherever a moral
is to be drawn, it is a noble and a healthy one. In
his merry moods he is irresistibly comic; when he
stands forward as a censor of morals, he is terrible
in his truth; when he creates a character, it is
always human and complete,&mdash;a true reflex of the
age in which he lived. Times may change, and
costumes, but humanity remains much the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Take any series of the splendid list, and the people
who crowd the canvas live and move amongst us
with different names and other attire. Such suggestive
cognomens as Mary Hackabout are not in use;
nor do procuresses haunt such localities as Wood
Street in pursuit of their vile calling. The course
of fashion, as of empire, has taken its way westward;
but the whole story of the Harlot's Progress is as
fresh and as applicable to a season in 1873 as it was
a hundred and forty years before. Have we not Tom
Rakewells in scores among us; and had Hogarth
been living now, would he not have interpolated
another picture of the degradation attained by the
spendthrift when he enters the employment of the
moneylender as a decoy to poor flies such as he
was himself at the beginning of the chapter? The
function of the satirist is still needed, and there is no
danger of the works of William Hogarth proving to
be out of date. Probably no artist ever told stories
so well; certainly no one ever acquired such a
reputation, and there is no reason why his splendid
monuments should be found only in the libraries
of the wealthy. Every one should know something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of him besides his moral lessons, since, of all the
moral lessons he ever taught, his life formed the most
pointed. Fearlessness and honesty were his watchwords
from his early career of art, after being released
from the silversmith's apprenticeship in 1720
until the day of his death in 1764, when he retired
from mundane existence full of years and honours.
As Ireland declares him to have asserted, his drawings
were meant for the crowd rather than for the
critics; and with that intention his book was commenced,
the original design being to comprise in
one volume "a moral and analytical description of
seventy-eight prints;" but as the work advanced,
such an amount of anecdote and illustrative comment
suggested itself, that he was compelled to adopt the
three-volume form which is here followed, with the
further addition to which we have alluded, of such
a full description and reproduction as the original
compiler, from accident or design, omitted. These
will be found in the third volume, and include many
of the most important and meritorious works of the
great artist. It has been found advisable to change
the ornamental and sometimes indistinct lettering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the original plates, and to adopt a consistent and
uniform style of titles. At the same time the elaborate
catalogue compiled by Ireland is preserved,
since it is still highly valuable as a chronological
list of every effort of Hogarth's hand, although it
would be folly to attempt a reproduction of every
variation it contains. The system pursued by
Ireland and Nichols is followed, and the Publishers
venture to congratulate themselves on submitting to
the notice of the artistic and literary world, as well
as to the public generally, the best and cheapest
edition of Hogarth's complete works ever brought
forward.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">Mr. Hogarth frequently asserted that no
man was so ill qualified to form a true
judgment of pictures as the professed connoisseur;
whose taste being originally formed upon
imitations, and confined to the manners of Masters,
had seldom any reference to Nature. Under this
conviction, his subjects were selected for the crowd
rather than the critic;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and explained in that universal
language common to the world, rather than in
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lingua technica</i> of the arts, which is sacred to the
scientific. Without presuming to support his hypothesis,
I have endeavoured to follow his example.</p>

<p>My original design was to have comprised in one
volume a moral and analytical description of seventy-eight
prints; but as the work advanced, such variety
of anecdote and long train of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cetera</i> clung to the
narrative, that these limits were found too narrow.
With the explanation of fifteen additional plates, the
letterpress has expanded to near seven hundred
pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the artist has been made a victim to poetical
or political prejudice, without meaning to be his
panegyrist, I have endeavoured to rescue his memory
from unmerited obloquy. Where his works have been
misconceived or misrepresented, I have attempted the
true reading. In my essay at an illustration of the
prints, with a description of what I conceive the comic
and moral tendency of each, there is the best information
I could procure concerning the relative circumstances,
occasionally interspersed with such desultory
conversation as frequently occurred in turning over
a volume of his prints. Though the notes may not
always have an immediate relation to the engravings,
I hope they will seldom be found wholly unconnected
with the subjects.</p>

<p>Such mottoes as were engraven on the plates
are inserted; but where a print has been published
without any inscription, I have either selected or
written one. Errors in either parody or verse with
the signature E, being written by the editor, are submitted
to that tribunal from whose candour he hopes
pardon for every mistake or inaccuracy which may be
found in these volumes.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">When <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Leonarda da Vinci'">Leonardo da Vinci</ins> lay upon his
death-bed, Francis the First, actuated
by that instinctive reverence which great
minds invariably feel for each other, visited him in
his chamber. An attendant informing the painter
that the king was come to inquire after his health,
he raised himself from the pillow, a lambent gleam
of gratitude for the honour lighted up his eyes, and
he made an effort to speak. The exertion was
too much; he fell back; and Francis stooping to
support him, this great artist expired in his arms.
Affected with the awful catastrophe, the king heaved
a sigh of sympathetic sorrow, and left the bed-chamber
in tears. He was immediately surrounded by a
crowd of those kind-hearted nobles who delight in
soothing the sorrows of a sovereign; and one of
them entreating him not to indulge his grief, added,
as a consolatory reflection, "Consider, sire, this man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was but a painter." "I do," <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'reply the monarch'">replied the monarch</ins>; "and
I at the same time consider, that though, as a king,
I could make a thousand such as you, the Deity
alone can make such a painter as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Leonarda da Vinci'">Leonardo da Vinci</ins>."</p>

<p>Shall I be permitted to adopt this remark, and,
without any diminution of the Italian's well-earned
fame, assert that the eulogy is equally appropriate
to the Englishman whose name is at the head of
this chapter; for he was not the follower, but the
leader of a class, and became a painter from divine
impulse rather than human instruction.</p>

<p>The biographers who have written of artists,
especially if the hero of their history was of the
Dutch school, generally began by informing us that
he received the rudiments of his art from the great
Van A&mdash;, who was a pupil of the divine Van B&mdash;,
first the disciple, and afterwards the rival, of the
immortal and never enough to be admired Vander C.</p>

<p>This <em>palette pedigree</em> was not the boast of William
Hogarth; he was the pupil,&mdash;the disciple,&mdash;the worshipper
of nature!</p>

<p>I do not learn that his family either obtained a
grant of lands from our first William, or <em>flourished</em>
before the Conquest; but from Burn's History of
Westmoreland, it appears that his grandfather was an
honest yeoman, the inhabitant of a small tenement
in the vale of Bampton, a village fifteen miles north
of Kendal, and had three sons. The eldest, in conformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to ancient custom, succeeded to the <em>title</em>,
<em>honour</em>, and <em>estate</em> of his father, became a yeoman of
Bampton, and proprietor of the family freehold.</p>

<p>The second was not endowed with either land or
beeves, but had in their stead a large portion of
broad humour and wild original genius. Like his
nephew, he grasped the whip of satire; and though
his lash was not twisted with much skill, nor brandished
with much grace, it was probably felt by
those on whom his strokes were inflicted, more than
would one of the most exquisite workmanship.</p>

<p>He was the Shakspeare of his village, and his
dramas were the delight of the country; though,
being written by an uneducated yeoman, it may
naturally be supposed they were sufficiently coarse.
Mr. Nichols, in his Anecdotes, tells us that he has
seen a whole bundle of them, and <em>want of grammar,
metre, sense, and decency is their invariable characteristic</em>.
This may possibly be true, for in refinement
Westmoreland was many, many years behind
the capital; and our libraries contain <em>sundrie black-letter
proofs</em> that those <em>pithie</em>, <em>pleasaunte</em>, and <em>merrie
comedies</em>, which in the same century were <em>enacted by
the Kingis servantes</em> with universal applause, had
similar <em>wants</em>; notwithstanding which, these unalloyed
chronicles of our ancestors' dulness are <em>now</em>
purchased at a price considerably higher than virgin
gold. Let it not from hence be imagined that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mean to sanction one folly by the mention of
another; but as every human production is <em>relative</em>,
if auld Hogarth, under the circumstances he wrote,
was the admiration of his neighbours, we may fairly
infer that his talents, properly cultivated, would, in
a more polished situation, have ensured him the
admiration of his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>Richard was the third son, and seems to have been
intended for a scholar,&mdash;the scholar of his family!&mdash;for
he was educated at St. Bees, in Westmoreland,
and afterward kept a school in the same county. Of
learning he had a portion more than sufficient for his
office, for he wrote a Latin and English dictionary,
which still exists in <span class="fs70">MS.</span>, and one of his Latin letters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
dated 1657, preserved in the British Museum.
However well he might be qualified for a teacher, he
had few pupils; and finding that his employment produced
neither honour nor profit, removed to London,
and in Ship Court, Old Bailey, renewed his profession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>It was fortunate for literature that Doctor Samuel
Johnson was not successful in an application for the
place of a provincial schoolmaster. It was fortunate
for the arts that Richard Hogarth was not able to
establish a village school, in which situation he would
probably have qualified his son William for his successor;
and those talents which were calculated to
instruct, astonish, and reform a world, might have
been wasted in teaching some half a hundred of the
young Westmoreland gentry to scan verses by their
fingers, and call English things by Latin names.
The fates ordained otherwise; it was his destiny to
marry and reside in London, where were born unto
him one son and two daughters.</p>

<p>The girls had such instructions as qualified them
to keep a shop; and the son, who drew his first
breath in this bustling world in the year 1697, was
author of the prints which, copied in little, form the
basis and give the value to these volumes.</p>

<p>Of his education we do not know much; but as his
father appears to have been a man of understanding,
I suppose it was sufficient for the situation in which
he was intended to be placed. That it was not more
liberal, might arise from the old man finding erudition
answer little purpose to himself, and knowing that in
a mechanic employment it is rather a drawback than
an assistance. Added to this, I believe young Hogarth
had not much bias <em>towards what has obtained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
name</em> of learning. He must have been early attentive
to the appearance of the passions, and feeling a
strong impulse to attempt their delineation, left their
names and derivations to the profound pedagogue,
the accurate grammarian, or more sage and solemn
lexicographer. While these labourers in the forest of
science dug for the root, inquired into the circulation
of the sap, and planted brambles and birch round the
tree of knowledge, Hogarth had an higher aim,&mdash;an
ambition to display, in the true tints of nature, the
rugged character of the bark, the varied involutions
of the branches, and the minute fibres of the leaves.</p>

<p>The first notices of his prints were written in
French, by a Swiss named Rouquet, who in 1746
published "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres de Monsieur * * à un de ses Amis
à Paris, pour lui expliquer les Estampes de Monsieur
Hogarth</i>."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This pamphlet describes the Harlot's
and Rake's Progress, Marriage à la Mode, and March
to Finchley. In the remarks, there is great reason to
believe Rouquet was assisted by Hogarth, who long
afterwards expressed an intention of having them
translated and amplified. From such a junction, the
reader will naturally expect this book to contain
more information than he will find.</p>

<p>The second publication was by the Reverend
Doctor Trusler, and extends farther than the preceding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
It was begun immediately after the artist's
death, is baptized <em>Hogarth Moralized</em>, and interspersed
with seventy-eight engravings, printed on the
same paper with the letterpress. It contains two
hundred pages, built upon Rouquet's pamphlet, and
the information he received from Mrs. Hogarth, who,
conceiving her property would be essentially injured
by such a publication, purchased the copyright. As
the Doctor does not profess <em>an intimate acquaintance</em>
with the arts, and confines himself to <em>morality</em>!&mdash;I
hope and believe my work will <em>not much</em> clash with his.</p>

<p>Of the artist and his prints, we had no regular narrative
until the appearance of Mr. Walpole's <cite>Anecdotes
of Painting</cite>,&mdash;a work in which refined taste and
elegant diction gave rank and importance to a class
of men whose history, in the writings of preceding
biographers, exhibited little more than a catalogue of
names, or a dry uninteresting narrative of uninteresting
events. To the pen of this highly accomplished
writer, William Hogarth owes a portion of his deserved
celebrity; for in near fifty pages devoted to
his name, we find the history of <em>a great man's excellencies
and errors</em> written with the warmth of a friend
and the fidelity of a chronologist. With the first
tolerably complete catalogue of his works, there was
such remarks upon their meaning and tendency, as
have given the artist a new character; for though his
superlative merit secured him admiration from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
few who were able to judge, he was considered by the
crowd as a mere <em>caricaturist</em>, whose only aim was to
burlesque whatever he represented.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Gilpin, in his valuable Essay on
Prints, has made some observations on one series by
Hogarth. The remarks were evidently written in
haste; and though in a few instances I cannot coincide
with a gentleman for whose worth and talents I have
the most unfeigned respect, I am convinced that the
candour of the Vicar of Boldre will forgive the freedom
taken with the critic on the <cite>Rake's Progress</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1781, Mr. Nichols published his <cite>Anecdotes</cite>, which
since that time have been considerably enlarged.
This work contains much useful information relative
to the artist; and much monumental miscellany from
the Grub Street Journal, and other ancient sources,
concerning his contemporaries, that were it not there
enniched, would in all probability have sunk in dark
and endless night. Where Mr. Walpole and preceding
writers threw a hair-line, he cast the <em>antiquarian
drag-net</em>, and brought from the great deep a miraculous
draught of aquatic monsters and web-footed animals,
that swam round the triumphal bark of William
Hogarth. For the information which I received from
his volume, he has my best thanks; where I depart
from his authorities, it is on the presumption that my
own are better. In many cases, it is more than possible
both of us are frequently mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>In this I believe we agree,&mdash;<em>that young Hogarth
had an early predilection for the arts</em>, and his future
acquirements give us a right to suppose he must
have studied the <em>curious sculptures</em> which adorned his
father's <em>spelling books</em>, though he neglected the letterpress;
and when he ought to have been storing his
memory with the eight parts of speech, was examining
the <em>allegorical apple-tree</em> which decorates the grammar.
These <em>first lines</em> of nature inclined his father
to place him with an engraver; but workers in copper
were not numerous, neither did the demand for
English prints warrant a certainty of any additional
number obtaining constant employment. Engraving
on plate seemed likely to afford a more permanent
subsistence, required some taste for drawing, and
had a remote alliance with the arts. These reasons
being seconded by his own inclination, our juvenile
satirist was apprenticed to Mr. Ellis Gamble, who
kept a silversmith's shop in Cranbourn Alley, Leicester
Fields. This vendor of salvers and sauce-boats
had in his own house two or three <em>rare artisans</em>,
whose employment was to engrave cyphers and
armorial symbols, not only on the articles their
master sold, but on any that he might have to mark
from <em>cunning workmen</em>, in silver or meaner metals.
In this branch he covenanted to instruct William
Hogarth, who about the year 1712 became a practical
student in Mr. Gamble's <em>Attic Academy</em>. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<em>school of science</em>, we may fairly conjecture his first
essays were the initials on tea-spoons; he would
next be taught the <em>art</em> and <em>mystery</em> of the double
cypher, where four letters in opposite directions are
so skilfully interwoven, that it requires almost an
apprenticeship to learn the art of deciphering them.
Having conquered his alphabet, he ascended to the
representation of those heraldic monsters which first
grinned upon the shields of the holy army of
crusaders, and were from thence transferred to the
massy tankards and ponderous two-handled cups of
their stately descendants. By copying this legion of
<em>hydras, gorgons, and chimeras dire</em>, he attained an
early taste for the ridiculous; and in the grotesque
countenance of a baboon or a bear, the cunning eye
of a fox, or the fierce front of a rampant lion, traced
the characteristic varieties of the human physiognomy.
He soon felt that <em>the science which appertaineth unto
the bearing of coat armour</em> was not suited to his taste
or talents; and tired of the amphibious many-coloured
brood that people the fields of heraldry, listened
to the voice of Genius, which whispered him <em>to read
the mind's construction in the face</em>,&mdash;to study and
delineate <span class="fs80">MAN</span>.</p>

<p>As the first token of his turn for the <em>satirical</em>, it may
be worth recording, that while yet an apprentice,
when upon a sultry Sunday he once made an excursion
to Highgate, two or three of his companions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
himself sought shelter and refreshment in one of those
convenient <em>caravanserais</em> which so much abound in the
vicinity of the metropolis. In the same room were a
party of thirsty pedestrians, washing down the dust
they had inhaled in their walk, with <em>London porter</em>.
Two of the company debating upon politics, and the
palm of victory being, at the moment Hogarth and
his companions entered, adjudged to the taller man,
he very vociferously exulted in his conquest, and
added some sarcastic remarks on the diminutive appearance
of his adversary. The <em>little</em> man had <em>a great
soul</em>, and having in his right hand a pewter pot, threw
it with fatal force at his opponent: it struck him in
the forehead,&mdash;and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse12">"As the mountain oak</p>
<p class="verse">Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound</p>
<p class="verse">It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">he sunk to the floor, and there,&mdash;as the divine Ossian
would have sublimely expressed it,&mdash;<em>The grey mist
swam before his eyes. He lay in the hall of mirth as a
mountain pine, when it tumbles across the rushy Loda.&mdash;He
recovered; lifted up his bleeding head, and rolled
his full-orbed eyes around. He ascended as a pillar of
smoke streaked with fire, and streams of blood ran down
his dark brown cheeks, like torrents from the summit
of an oozy rock, etc. etc.</em></p>

<p>To descend from the <em>pinnacle of Parnassus</em> to the
<em>plain of common sense</em>,&mdash;the fellow being deeply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
though not dangerously, wounded in the forehead,
extreme agony excited a most hideous grin. His
<em>woe-begone</em> figure, opposed to the pert triumphant air
of his tiny conqueror, and the half suppressed laugh
of his surrounding friends, presented a scene too
ridiculous to be resisted. The young tyro seized
his pencil, drew his first group of portraits from the
life, and gave, with a strong resemblance of each,
such a grotesque variety of character as evades all
description.</p>

<p>When we consider this little sketch was his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
d'essai</i>, the loss of it is much to be regretted.</p>

<p>He probably made many others during his apprenticeship.
When that expired, bidding adieu to <em>red
lions</em> and <em>green dragons</em>, he endeavoured to attain such
knowledge of drawing as would enable him to delineate
the human figure, and transfer his <em>burin</em> from
silver to copperplate. In this attempt he had to
encounter many difficulties; engraving on copper was
so different an art from engraving on silver, that it
was necessary he should <em>un</em>learn much which he had
already learned; and at twenty years of age, habits
are too deeply rooted to be easily eradicated; so that
he never attained the power of describing that clear,
beautiful stroke which was then given by some foreign
artists, and has since been brought, I believe, to its
utmost perfection by Sir Robert Strange.</p>

<p>In his first efforts he had little more assistance than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
could be acquired by casual communications, or imitating
the works of others;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> those of Callot were probably
his first models; and shop-bills and book-plates his
first performances. Some of these, with impressions
from tankards and tea-tables which escaped the crucible,
have, by the laudable industry of collectors, been
preserved to the present day. How far they add to
the artist's fame, or are really of the value at which
they are sometimes purchased, is a question of too
high import for me to decide. By the connoisseur it
is asserted, that the earliest productions of a great
painter ought to be preserved, for they soar superior
to the mature labours of plodding dulness, and though
but seeds of that genius intended by nature to tower
above its contemporaries, invariably exhibit <em>clear
marks of mind</em>; as every variety in the branches of
a strong-ribbed oak is, by the aid of a microscope,
discoverable in the acorn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>By the opposite party it is urged, that collecting
these <em>blotted leaves of fancy</em>, is burying a man of
talents in the ruins of his <em>baby-house</em>; and that for the
honour of his name, and <em>repose of his soul</em>, they ought
to be consigned to the flames, rather than pasted in
the <em>portfolio</em>.</p>

<p>I must candidly acknowledge, that for trifles by
the hand of Hogarth or Mortimer, I have a kind of
religious veneration; but, like the rebuses and riddles
of Swift, they are still trifles, and except when considered
as tracing the progress of the mind from
infancy to manhood, are not entitled to much attention.
If examined with this regard, especial care
should be taken that their names are not dishonoured
by the unmeaning and contemptible productions of
inferior artists, some of whose prints have found a
place in the catalogue of Hogarth's works. Mr.
Nichols properly questions the plate of <cite>Æneas in a
Storm</cite>: he might safely put the same query to <cite>Riche's
Triumphal Entry into Covent Garden</cite>, and a few other
plates, which some of the collectors have <em>very positively</em>
asserted to be his. The <cite>Jack in Office</cite> and <cite>Pug
the Painter</cite>, I believe, belong to other collectors.
That <em>the design for General Wolfe's monument</em> should
ever be supposed the work of Hogarth, has often
astonished me. I do not see the most distant resemblance
of his manner, in mind, conception, design, or
execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Many stories, similar to those which are told of the
manner that other painters revenged an insult, or
supplied the exigencies of the moment, are related of
young Hogarth. If true, these volumes would gain
little interest by their insertion, for few of them are
worthy of a memorial; and if false, they ought not to
be admitted.</p>

<p>That a young artist, just emancipated from the
obscurity of a silversmith's garret, should be unknown,
we naturally suppose; that talents, however exalted,
should not be noticed by the public until the professor
gave some proofs of superiority, may be
readily credited.</p>

<p>That a youth of volatile dispositions, who had
neither inheritance nor protection, must frequently
want money, follows as certainly as night to day;
and we place full confidence in the assertion, when
told that he has frequently said, "I remember the
time when I have gone moping into the city with
scarce a shilling in my pocket; but having received
ten guineas there for a plate, returned home, put on
my sword and bag, and sallied out again, with all
the confidence of a man who had ten thousand
pounds in his pocket."</p>

<p>I can believe that the elder Mr. Bowles was his
first patron; but when Mr. Nichols informs us, on
the authority of Doctor Ducarrel, that this <em>patron</em>
offered the young engraver half-a-crown a pound for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a plate just finished, rejoice that the inauspicious
period when such talents had such patronage<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is
past.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Walpole well observes, that the history
of an artist must be sought in his works. The earliest
date I have seen on any of Hogarth's engravings
is his own shop-bill, bordered with two figures
and two Cupids, and inscribed April 20, 1720. From
this and similar mechanic blazonry, he ascended to
prints for books, in the execution of which it was
not necessary to have much knowledge of the arts.
If they were <em>copperplates</em>, the public were satisfied;
neither spirit of design, accuracy of drawing, nor
delicacy of stroke were demanded. Six engravings,
containing six compartments each, for King's <cite>History
of the Heathen Gods</cite>, I should apprehend were among
the earliest. I have heard them doubted, and they
are not mentioned in either Mr. Walpole's or Mr.
Nichols' list; but I believe them to be as certainly
Hogarth's as the Rake's Progress.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>In two emblematical prints on the lottery, and the
South Sea Bubble, published in 1721, there is not
much merit; and in the fifteen for Aubrey de la
Mottraye's Travels, dated 1723, we only regret that
so much time and copper should be wasted.</p>

<p>The <cite>Burlington Gate</cite>, which appeared in 1724, is
in a very superior style, and in the spirit of Callot.
With some very well pointed satire on the general
passion for masquerades, and other ridiculous <em>raree-shows</em>,
it unites a burlesque of Kent the architect, who
upon the pediment of his patron's gate is exalted
above Raphael and Michael Angelo. From this
circumstance I think it probable that the print was
engraved as a sort of admission ticket to Sir James
Thornhill's academy, which was opened that year.
The knight would unquestionably be gratified by
this ridicule of his rival, and might in consequence
admit the young artist to such a degree of intimacy
as enabled him to gain the heart and hand of Miss
Thornhill. The burlesque copy of Kent's altar-piece
at St. Clement's Church was published in 1725; and
fifteen headpieces for Bever's Military Punishments
in the same year.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>By seventeen small plates, with a head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
author for Butler's <cite>Hudibras</cite>, printed in 1726, he first
became known in his profession. In design, these
are almost direct copies from a series inserted in a
small edition of the same book, published sixteen
years before. Whether this originated in a wish to
save himself the trouble of making original designs,
or in the twenty booksellers for whom this edition
was published, is not easy to determine. These
<em>midwives to the Muses</em> might think he was upon safer
ground while copying the designs of an artist
sanctioned by public approbation, than in following
<em>his own inventions</em>, and in this opinion our young
engraver might possibly join. Taking these circumstances
into the account, I do not agree with Mr.
Walpole, when he observes that <em>we are surprised to
find so little humour in an undertaking so congenial to
his talents</em>. If these prints are considered as copies,
they ought not to be produced as a criterion; if
compared with those from which they are taken, it is
not easy to conceive a greater superiority than he has
attained over his originals. Neatness was not required;
and for such subjects I prefer the spirited
etchings of a Hogarth to the most delicate finishing
of a Bartolozzi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Copies of them are inserted in Grey's Hudibras,
published 1744, and Townley's French translation,
printed <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à Londres</cite>, 1757. In Grey's edition, the head
of Butler is not copied from Hogarth, who certainly
had for his pattern White's mezzotint of John Baptist
Monoyer the flower painter, from Sir Godfrey
Kneller: to any portrait that I have ever seen of
Samuel Butler, it has not the faintest resemblance;
and how the artist came to give it that name, it is
difficult to guess.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The large series on that subject were published the
same year, and are thus entitled: <cite>Twelve excellent
and most diverting prints taken from the celebrated
poem of Hudibras, written by Mr. Samuel Butler,
exposing the villany and hypocrisy of the times,
invented and engraved on twelve copperplates, by
William Hogarth, and are humbly dedicated to
William Ward, Esq. of Great Houghton, in Northamptonshire,
and Mr. Allan Ramsay of Edinburgh.</cite><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"What excellence can brass or marble claim!</p>
<p class="verse">These papers better do secure thy fame:</p>
<p class="verse">Thy verse all monuments does far surpass;</p>
<p class="verse">No mausoleum's like thy Hudibras."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Allan Ramsay subscribed for thirty sets. The
number of subscribers in all, amounts to 192.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Walker of Queen Anne Street had a
sketch of Hudibras and Ralpho, painted by Isaac
Fuller, very much in the manner of Hogarth, who I
think must have seen, and, in the early part of his
life, studied Fuller's pictures.</p>

<p>Seven of the drawings were in the possession of the
late Mr. Samuel Ireland, three are in Holland, and
two are said to have been in the collection of a
person in one of the northern provinces about twenty
years ago, but are now probably destroyed. Thus
are the works of genius scattered like the <em>Sibyl's
leaves</em>.</p>

<p>Hogarth seems to have been particularly partial to
this subject; for, previous to engraving the twelve
large plates, he painted it in oil. The twelve original
pictures, somewhat larger than the prints, are in the
possession of the editor of these volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The variety with which the characteristic distinctions
of the figures are marked, the firm and spirited
touch with which each of the characters are pencilled,
is peculiar to this artist: they come into that class
of pictures, which to those who have not seen them
cannot be described; to those who have, a description
is unnecessary.</p>

<p>In a masquerade ticket, published 1727, he has a
second time introduced John James Heidegger, of
ill-favoured memory. Notwithstanding Lord Chesterfield's
wager, that this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Surintendant des plaisirs
d'Angleterre</i> did not produce a man with so hideous
a countenance as his own, and Pope having honoured
him with a place in his Dunciad, when describing</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse10">"A monster of a fowl,</p>
<p class="verse">Something between a <em>Heidegger</em> and owl,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">and his ugliness being in a degree proverbial, an
engraving of his face from a mask, taken after his
death, and inserted in Lavater's Physiognomy, has
strong marks of a benevolent character, and features
by no means displeasing or disagreeable.</p>

<p>The print of our <em>decollating</em> Harry and Anna
Boleyne, is engraved from a painting once in Vauxhall
Gardens.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Whatever might be the picture, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
print is in every point of view contemptible. His
frontispieces to Apuleius and Cassandra, Perseus and
Andromeda, John Gulliver, and the Highland Fair,
come in precisely the same class. Those to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terræ
Filius</i>, the Humours of Oxford, and Tom Thumb,
have some traces of comedy.</p>

<p>Various temporary satires on the local follies and
vices of the day, which he engraved about this time,
are enumerated by Mr. Walpole and Mr. Nichols, but
have not in general much merit. The compliments
he paid to Sir James Thornhill, by ridiculing William
Kent, have been noticed in the preceding pages;
but Hogarth's partiality was not confined to the
knight, he extended it to the knight's daughter, and
finding <em>favour in her sight</em>,&mdash;without the formal ceremony
of asking consent, or the tedious process of
a settlement,&mdash;<em>took her to wife</em>. This union being
neither sanctioned by her father,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> nor accompanied
with a fortune, compelled him to redouble his professional
exertions.</p>

<p>His first large print was Southwark Fair, a natural
and highly ludicrous representation of the plebeian
amusements of that period; but by the Harlot's Progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
he in 1734 established his character as a
painter of domestic history. When his wife's father
saw the designs, their originality of idea, regularity
of narration, and fidelity of scenery, convinced him
that such talents would force themselves into notice,
and when known, must be distinguished and patronized.
Among a great number of copies which the
success of these prints tempted obscure artists to
make, there was one set printed on two large sheets
of paper, for G. King, Brownlow Street, which, being
made with the author's consent, may possibly contain
some additions suggested and inserted by Hogarth's
directions. In Plate I., beneath the sign of the Bell,
<span class="fs80">PARSONS INTIER BUTT BEAR</span>. In Plate II., to the
picture of Jonah under a gourd, a label, <em>Jonah, why
art thou angry?</em> and under one of the portraits is
written, Mr. Woolston. Below each scene, an inscription
describes, in true <em>beaux' spelling</em>; the meaning of
the prints, and points out two of the characters to
be Colonel Charteris and Sir John Gonson. To the
strong resemblance the latter of these delineations
bore to the original, Mr. Hogarth is said to be indebted
for much of his popularity. The magistrate
being universally known, a striking portrait <em>in little</em>
would then, as now, have a more numerous band of
admirers than the best conceived moral satire.</p>

<p>In 1735, when he published his Rake's Progress
with a view of <em>stranding the pirates of the arts</em>, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
solicited and obtained an Act to vest an exclusive
right in designers and engravers, and restrain the
multiplying copies of their works without their consent.</p>

<p>Like many other <em>Acts of Parliament</em>, it was inaccurately
worded, and very inadequate to the evil it professed
to cure; for Lord Hardwicke determined that
no assignee, claiming under an assignment from the
original inventor, could receive advantage from it:
though after Hogarth's death, the Legislature, by Stat.
7th, Geo. <span class="fs70">III.</span>, granted to his widow a further term of
twenty years in the property of her husband's works.</p>

<p>In 1736, at the particular desire of a nobleman,
whose name deserves no commemoration, he engraved
two prints, entitled <cite>Before</cite> and <cite>After</cite>. There are
few examples of this artist making designs from
the thoughts of others. The Sleeping Congregation,
Distressed Poet, Enraged Musician, Strolling
Actresses, Modern Midnight Conversation, and many
genuine comedies of a new description, where the
humour of five acts is brought into one scene, were
the productions of his own mind. From these and
other mirrors of the times, he was considered as an
original author; and being now in the plenitude of his
fame,&mdash;conceiving himself established in reputation,
and conscious of being first in his peculiar walk,&mdash;he,
on the 25th of Jan. 1744-5, printed proposals, offering
the paintings of his Harlot's and Rake's Progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Four Times of the Day, and Strolling Actresses, to
public sale, by an auction of a most singular nature.</p>

<p>"I. Every bidder shall have an entire leaf numbered
in the book of sale, on the top of which will be
entered his name and place of abode, the sum paid
by him, the time when, and for which picture.</p>

<p>"II. That on the last day of sale, a clock (striking
every five minutes) shall be placed in the room; and
when it hath struck five minutes after twelve, the first
picture mentioned in the sale book will be deemed as
sold; the second picture, when the clock hath struck
the next five minutes after twelve; and so on successively
till the whole nineteen pictures are sold.</p>

<p>"III. That none advance less than gold at each
bidding.</p>

<p>"IV. No person to bid on the last day, except
those whose names were before entered in the book.
As Mr. Hogarth's room is but small, he begs the
favour that no person, except those whose names are
entered in the book, will come to view his paintings
on the last day of sale."</p>

<p>A method so novel possibly disgusted the town:
they might not exactly understand this tedious formulæ
of entering their names and places of abode in
a book open to indiscriminate inspection; they might
wish to humble an artist, who, by his proposals,
seemed to consider that he did the world a favour in
suffering them to bid for his works; or the <em>rage</em> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
paintings might be confined to the admirers of <em>old
masters</em>. Be that as it may, for his nineteen pictures
he received only four hundred and twenty-seven
pounds seven shillings,&mdash;a price by no means equal
to their merit.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The <em>prints</em> of the Harlot's Progress had sold much
better than those of the Rake's; yet the <em>paintings</em> of
the former produced only fourteen guineas each,
while those of the latter were sold for twenty-two!
That admirable picture, <cite>Morning</cite>, twenty guineas,&mdash;<cite>Night</cite>,
in every point inferior to almost any of his
works, six-and-twenty!</p>

<p>As a ticket of admission to this sale, he engraved

</div>

<p class="noindent">In one corner of this very ludicrous print he has
represented an auction-room, on the top of which
is a weathercock, in allusion perhaps to Cock the
auctioneer. Instead of the four initials for North,
East, West, and South, we have P, U, F, S, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>with a little allowance for bad spelling, must pass for
<em>Puffs</em>! At the door stands a porter, who from the
length of his staff may be high-constable of the old
school, and gentleman-usher to the modern connoisseurs.
As an attractive show-board, we have an high-finished
Flemish head, in one of those ponderous
carved and gilt frames, that give the <em>miniatures</em>
inserted in them the appearance of a glow-worm in
a gravel pit. A catalogue and a carpet (properly
enough called the <em>flags of distress</em>) are <em>now</em> the signs
of a sale; but <em>here</em>, at the end of a long pole, we
have an unfurled standard, emblazoned with that
<em>oracular talisman</em> of an auction-room, the <em>fate-deciding
hammer</em>. Beneath is a picture of St. Andrew on the
cross, with an immense number of <em>fac-similes</em>, each
inscribed <em>ditto</em>. <em>Apollo</em>, who is flaying <em>Marsyas</em>, has
no mark of a deity, except the rays which beam from
his head; he is placed under a projecting branch, and
we may truly say the tree shadows what it ought to
support. The coolness of poor Marsyas is perfectly
philosophical; he endures torture with the apathy of a
Stoic. The third tier is made up by a herd of Jupiters
and Europas, of which <em>interesting</em> subject, as well as
the foregoing, there are <em>dittos</em>, <em>ad infinitum</em>. These
invaluable <em>tableaux</em> being unquestionably painted by
the great Italian masters, is a proof of their unremitting
industry;&mdash;their labours evade calculation; for
had they acquired the <em>polygraphic</em> art of striking off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
pictures with the facility that printers roll off copperplates,
and each of them attained the age of Methusaleth,
they could not have painted <em>all</em> that are
exhibited under their names. Nothing is therefore
left us to suppose, but that <em>some of these undoubted
originals</em> were painted by their disciples.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Such are
the <em>collections</em> of <em>fac-similes</em>; the other pictures are
drawn up in battle array; we will begin with that of
<cite>St. Francis</cite>, the corner of which is in a most unpropitious
way driven through Hogarth's <cite>Morning</cite>. The
third painting of the Harlot's Progress suffers equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
degradation from a weeping Madonna, while the
splendid saloon of the repentant pair in Marriage à
la Mode is broken by the Aldobrandini Marriage.
Thus far is rather in favour of the ancients; but the
aerial combat has a different termination: for, by the
riotous scene in the Rake's Progress, a hole is made
in Titian's Feast of Olympus; and a Bacchanalian, by
Rubens, shares the same fate from the Modern Midnight
Conversation. Considered as so much reduced,
the figures are etched with great spirit, and have
strong character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>In ridicule of the preference given to old pictures,
he exercised not only his pencil, but his pen. His
advertisement for the sale of the paintings of Marriage
à la Mode, inserted in a Daily Advertiser of
1750, thus concludes:</p>

<p>"As, according to the standard so righteously
and laudably established by picture-dealers, picture-cleaners,
picture-frame makers (and other connoisseurs),
the works of a painter are to be esteemed
more or less valuable as they are more or less scarce,
and as the living painter is most of all affected by
the inferences resulting from this and other considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
equally candid and edifying, Mr. Hogarth by
way of precaution, not puff, begs leave to urge that
probably this will be the last sale of pictures he may
ever exhibit, because of the difficulty of vending such
a number at once to any tolerable advantage; and
that the whole number he has already exhibited of
the historical or humorous kind does not exceed
fifty, of which the three sets called the Harlot's Progress,
the Rake's Progress, and that now to be sold,
make twenty: so that whoever has a taste of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to rely on, and is not too squeamish, and has courage
enough to own it, by daring to give them a place in
a collection till Time (the supposed finisher, but real
destroyer of paintings) has rendered them fit for
those more sacred repositories where schools, names,
heads, masters, etc., attain their last stage of preferment,
may from hence be convinced that multiplicity,
at least, of his, Mr. Hogarth's pieces, will be no diminution
of their value."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>In the same year with the Battle of the Pictures
he etched the subscription-ticket for Garrick in
Richard <span class="fs80">III.</span>; where, in a festoon with a mask, a roll
of paper, a palette, and a laurel, he combines the
drama and the arts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle he visited
France. A people so different from any he had before
seen, and manners so inimical to his own, greatly
disgusted him. Ignorance of the language, added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to some unpleasant circumstances that had their rise
in his own imprudence, form a slight apology for
these prejudices; he <em>told them to the world</em> in a view
of the Gates of Calais, under which article I have
inserted a cantata written by his friend Forest. The
portrait in a cap, with a palette, on which is the
waving <em>line of beauty and grace</em>, he this year engraved
from his own painting. Beneath the frame are three
books, labelled, Shakspeare, Milton, Swift; and on
one side his faithful and favourite dog Trump. As
Hogarth afterwards erased <em>the human face divine</em>, and
inserted the <em>divine</em> Churchill in the character of a
bear, the print is become very scarce; a small copy
adorns the title-page to this volume. Some despicable
rhymes on the dog and painter were published
in the Scandalizade. Thus do the lines conclude:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The very self same,&mdash;how boldly they strike!</p>
<p class="verse">And I can't forbear thinking they're somewhat alike.</p>
<p class="verse">Oh fie! to a dog would you Hogarth compare?</p>
<p class="verse">Not so,&mdash;I say only, they're like as it were;</p>
<p class="verse">A respectable pair, all spectators allow,</p>
<p class="verse">And that they deserve a description below,</p>
<p class="verse">In capital letters, <span class="fs80">BEHOLD WE ARE TWO</span>."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Those who are personally acquainted with Hogarth
deem this print a strong likeness: the picture is remarkably
well painted, better than any I have seen
from his pencil, except the head of Captain Coram,
now in the <em>Foundling Hospital</em>. To that charity
Hogarth and several contemporary painters pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>sented
some of their performances. The attention
they obtained from the public induced the members of
an academy in St. Martin's Lane to attempt an extension
of the plan. With this view, a letter was printed,
and sent to the different artists. As it was the cornerstone
of that stupendous structure, now become a
Royal Academy, I have inserted a copy, with which I
was favoured by the gentleman to whom it is addressed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="pfs80">"TO MR. PAUL SANDBY.</p>

<p class="right fs80"><em>Academy of Painting, Sculpture, etc.,<br />
St. Martin's Lane, Tuesday, October the 23d, 1753.</em></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;There is a scheme set on foot for erecting
a public academy for the improvement of the arts of
painting, sculpture, and architecture; and as it is
thought necessary to have a certain number of professors,
with proper authority, in order to the making
regulations, taking in subscriptions, erecting a building,
instructing the students, and concerning all such
measures as shall be afterwards thought necessary,
your company is desired at the Turk's Head, in
Greek Street, Soho, on Tuesday the 13th of November,
at five o'clock in the evening precisely, to proceed
to the election of thirteen painters, three sculptors,
one chaser, two engravers, and two architects; in all
twenty-one, for the purposes aforesaid.&mdash;I am, Sir,
your most humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Francis Milner Newton</span>, <em>Sec.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>P.S.</em>&mdash;Please to bring the enclosed list, marked with
a cross before the names of thirteen painters, three
sculptors, one chaser, two engravers, and two architects,
as shall appear to you the most able artists
in their several professions, and in all other respects
the most proper for conducting this design. If you
cannot attend, it is expected that you will send your
list, sealed and enclosed in a cover, directed to me,
and write your name in the cover, without which no
regard will be paid to it.</p>

<p>"The list in that case will be immediately taken
out of the cover, and mixed with the other lists, so
that it shall not be known from whom it came; all
imaginable methods being concerted for carrying on
this election without favour or partiality. If you
know any artist of sufficient merit to be elected a
professor, who has been overlooked in drawing out
the list, be pleased to write his name, according to
his place in the alphabet, with a cross before it."</p></div>

<p>Their measures did not meet the approbation of
Mr. Hogarth. He thought that the establishment of
an academy would attract a crowd of young men to
neglect studies better suited to their powers, and
depart from more profitable pursuits: that every
boy who could chalk a straight-lined figure upon a
wall, would be led, by his mamma discovering that
it was <em>prodigious natural!</em> to mistake inclination for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ability, and suppose himself born for <em>shining in the
fine arts</em>!&mdash;that the streets would be crowded by
lads with palettes and portfolios, print-shops be as
numerous as porter-houses, and finally, that which
ought to be considered as a science, become a trade;
and what was still worse, a trade which would not
support its professors.</p>

<p>In near fifty years, that have <em>sunk like a sunbeam
in the sea</em>, the arts have assumed a new face; they at
this period form a very profitable branch of our commerce,
and his prophecy pertaining unto print-shops
is partly fulfilled.</p>

<p>It has been before observed that Mr. Hogarth, in
his own portrait, engraved as a frontispiece to his
works, drew a serpentine line on a painter's palette,
and denominated it&mdash;<em>The line of beauty</em>.</p>

<p>In the preface to his Analysis, he thus describes
the consequence of this denomination:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The bait soon took, and no Egyptian hieroglyphic
ever amused more than it did for a time; painters
and sculptors came to me to know the meaning of it,
being as much puzzled with it as other people, till it
came to have some explanation. Then indeed, but
not till then, some found it out to be an old acquaintance
of theirs; though the account they gave of its
properties was very near as satisfactory as that which
a day-labourer, who occasionally uses the lever, could
give of that machine as a mechanical power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Others, as common face-painters, and copiers of
pictures, denied that there could be such a rule either
in art or nature, and asserted it was all stuff and
madness; but no wonder that these gentlemen should
not be ready in comprehending a thing they have
little or no business with. For though the picture-copier
may sometimes, to a common eye, seem to vie
with the original he copies, the artist himself requires
no more ability, genius, or knowledge of nature, than
a <em>journeyman weaver</em> at the <em><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Gobelines'">Gobelins</ins></em>, who in working
after a piece of painting, bit by bit, scarcely knows
what he is about; whether he is weaving a man or a
horse; yet at last, almost insensibly, turns out of his
loom a fine piece of tapestry, representing, it may be,
one of Alexander's battles painted by Le Brun.</p>

<p>"As the above-mentioned print thus involved me
in frequent disputes, by explaining the qualities of
the line, I was extremely glad to find it (which I had
conceived as only part of a system in my own mind)
so well supported by a precept of Michael Angelo,
which was first pointed out to me by Dr. Kennedy, a
learned antiquarian and connoisseur, of whom I afterwards
purchased the translation, from which I have
taken several passages to my purpose."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>To explain this system, he in 1753 commenced
author, and published his Analysis, the professed
purpose of which was to fix the fluctuating ideas of
<em>taste</em>, by establishing a standard of beauty. This he
expected would be considered by his contemporaries,
as the ancients considered the little soldier modelled
by Policletus, the grammar of proportion, criterion
of elegance, and rule of perfection. It must be ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>knowledged
that this was expecting somewhat more
than his system deserved; but he received much
less. Sheets of good copper were defaced to prove,
in the first place, that <em>there was no such line</em>, and
in the next, that <em>he had stolen it from the ancients</em>.
Some called it the line of deformity, and others
the line of drunkenness. By a lady he was more
flattered: she told him it was precisely the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
which the sun makes in his annual motion round the
ecliptic.</p>

<p>His book is divided into chapters, treating of <em>fitness</em>,
<em>variety</em>, <em>symmetry</em>, <em>simplicity</em>, <em>intricacy</em>, <em>quantity</em>, <em>lines</em>,
<em>forms</em>, <em>composition with the waving line</em>, <em>proportion</em>,
<em>light and shade</em>, <em>colouring</em>, <em>attitude</em>, <em>and action</em>. The
hypothesis which he endeavours to establish is illustrated
by near three hundred explanatory figures,
with references to each.</p>

<p class="noindent">If the figures which compose this plate are considered
independent of the volume, they will appear sufficiently
incongruous. He has given us curves and curvatures,
straight lines and angles, circles and squares.
He has ransacked the garden for examples, and
drawn from the shops of the blacksmith, founder,
and cabinetmaker, illustrations of his doctrine. To
the beauteous and elegant Grecian Venus,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>opposed the venerable English judge, arrayed in an
ample robe, with his head enveloped in a periwig like
the mane of a lion. The naked majesty of the Apollo
Python is contrasted with an English actor, dressed
by a modern tailor and barber, to personate a Roman
general. The elegant winding lines of an Egyptian
sphynx are opposed by a bloated, overcharged, recumbent
Silenus. The uniform, coldly correct figures
of Albert Durer's drawing-book, that never deviate
into grace, to the antique <em>torso</em>, in which Michael
Angelo asserted he discovered every principle that
gave so grand a <em>gusto</em> to his own works. Three
anatomical representations of the muscles which
appear in a human leg when the skin is taken off, are
placed close to a shapeless pedestal in a shoe and
stocking, which by disease has, in the painter's phrase,
<em>lost its drawing</em>.</p>

<p>A fine wire, properly twisted round the figure of a
cone, represented in Number 26, as giving that elegant
wave which adds grace to beauty, is the leading
principle on which he builds his system of serpentine
lines. Of this ancient <em>grace</em>, opposed to modern <em>air</em>,
he could not have selected better examples than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Numbers 6 and 7, where Mr. Essex, an English
dancing-master, places himself in such an attitude
as he thinks the sculptor ought to have given the
Antinous, who he is ludicrously enough handing out
to dance a minuet.</p>

<p>Number 19 represents the <em>deep-mouth'd Quin!</em>
dressed in all the dignity of a playhouse wardrobe,
to perform the part of Brutus. That this (and not
Coriolanus) is the character meant by the artist, I
am inclined to think, from the statue of Julius Cæsar,
with a rope round his neck, immediately before him.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The rope is passed through a pulley, inserted in one of
those triple supporters of great weights, which some
of our provincial carpenters call a gallows, and passes
to upright beams intersected by poles, in the front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a monument, on which is seated a judge, over whose
head is another noosed pulley. How far this may
hint at any connection between the <em>law</em> and the <em>rope</em>
I cannot determine; but a weeping naked boy, who
is seated below, has in his hand what may pass for
the model of a gibbet as well as a square. Over the
judge's head is written, <span class="fs80">BIT DECEM.</span> 1752, <span class="fs80">ÆTATIS</span>;
the <span class="fs80">O</span> preceding <span class="fs80">BIT</span> is covered: I apprehend the
same judge may be found in a print of <span class="fs80">THE BENCH</span>.</p>

<p>A <em>new order</em> was Hogarth's favourite idea: he has
here made an attempt at a capital composed of hats
and periwigs.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <em>An infant with a man's wig and cap

<div class="caption">ANALYSIS OF BEAUTY, PLATE. II.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The fatigued figures that labour through this dance,
Mr. Hogarth in his 16th chapter thus explains:</p>


<p class="pfs90">OF ATTITUDE.</p>

<p>"Such dispositions of the body and limbs as appear
most graceful when seen at rest, depend upon gentle
winding contrasts, mostly governed by the precise
serpentine line, which in attitudes of authority are
more extended and spreading than ordinary, but
reduced somewhat below the medium of grace in
those of negligence and ease; and as much exaggerated
in insolent and proud carriage, or distortions of
pain (see Number 9, in <span class="smcap"><a href="#AB_I">Plate I</a>.</span>), as lessened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
contracted into plain and parallel lines, to express
meanness, awkwardness, and submission.</p>

<p>"The general idea of an action, as well as of an
attitude, may be given with a pencil in very few
lines. It is easy to conceive that the attitude of a
person upon the cross may be fully signified by the
true straight lines of the cross; so the extended
manner of St. Andrew's crucifixion is wholly understood
by the X-like cross.</p>

<p>"Thus, as two or three lines at first are sufficient to
show the intention of an attitude, I will take this
opportunity of presenting my reader with the sketch
of a country-dance, in the manner I began to set out
the design. In order to show how few lines are
necessary to express the first thoughts, as to different
attitudes, see Number 71 (top of the plate), which
describes in some measure the several figures and
actions, mostly of the ridiculous kind, that are represented
in the chief part of <a href="#AB_II">Plate II</a>.</p>

<p>"The most amiable person may deform his general
appearance by throwing his body and limbs into plain
lines; but such lines appear still in a more disagreeable
light in people of a particular make. I have
therefore chose such figures as I thought would agree
best with my first score of lines, Number 71.</p>

<p>"The two parts of curves next to 71, served for the
figures of the old woman and her partner, at the
farther end of the room. The curve, and two straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
lines at right angles, gave the hint for the fat man's
sprawling posture. I next resolved to keep a figure
within the bounds of a circle, which produced the
upper part of the fat woman, between the fat man
and the awkward one in the bag-wig, for whom I had
made a sort of an X. The prim lady his partner, in
the riding habit, by pecking back her elbows, as they
call it, from the waist upwards, made a tolerable D,
with a straight line under it, to signify the scanty
stiffness of her petticoat; and the Z stood for the
angular position the body makes with the legs and
thighs of the affected fellow in the tie-wig; the upper
part of his plump partner was confined to an O,
and this changed into a P, served as a hint for the
straight lines behind. The uniform diamond of a card
was filled up by the flying dress, etc. of the little
capering figure in the Spencer wig, whilst a double L
marked the parallel position of his poking partner's
hands and arms: and lastly, the two waving lines
were drawn for the more genteel turns of the two
figures at the hither end."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Such is the author's alphabetical analysis of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
serpentine system, which some of my readers may
possibly think borders on the visionary: certain it is,
that however he may have failed in his two specimens
of grace, those of awkwardness are carried as far as
they could have been in a Russian dance, when Peter
the Great ordained that no lady of any age should
presume to get drunk before nine o'clock.</p>

<p>I have seen the print framed as a companion to
Guido's <cite>Aurora</cite>; nothing surely can form a stronger
contrast to the golden age, when</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse10">"Universal Pan,</p>
<p class="verse">Knit with the Graces and the Hours, in dance</p>
<p class="verse">Led on th' eternal Spring."</p>
</div></div>

<p>They are said to represent the <em>Wanstead assembly</em>,
and contain portraits of the first Earl Tylney, his
Countess, their children, tenants, etc. In the tall
young lady he has evidently aimed at Milton's
description of motion&mdash;<em>smooth sliding without step</em>;
but her <em>air</em> is affected. Her noble partner was
originally intended for a portrait of the present King,
then Prince of Wales; and though I learn from Mr.
Walpole that it was afterward altered to the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Duke of Kingston, still retains so much of its original
designation as to bear a resemblance.</p>

<p>The design was made about the year 1728, and
might be a just representation of the Wanstead belles
and beaux; but since that period we have had so
many ship-loads of <em>grace</em> imported from the Continent,
and such numbers of <em>well-educated gentlemen</em>,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
who have exerted their talents in perfecting this <em>divine
art</em>, that the picture would not do for the present day.</p>

<p>The <em>sighing</em> Celadon, privately delivering a letter
<em>fraught with love</em> to his fair Amelia, is evidently the
native of a country that has furnished many of our
English heiresses with <em>good</em> husbands. Her impatient
father's watch is precisely twelve, which determines
what were then thought late hours, on so particular
an occasion as a wedding-ball, the sketch being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
originally designed for a series illustrative of <em>a happy
marriage</em>.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Hogarth is said to have boasted that each of the
hats which lie upon the floor are so characteristic of
their respective proprietors, that any man who understood
the form of the human <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput</i> might assign each
to its owner. Among them is a cushion, which was
formerly part of the ball-room furniture, for what was
called <em>the cushion-dance</em>, in the progress of which the
gentleman kneels down and salutes his partner.</p>

<p>The light diffused from the chandelier shows an
attention to nature worthy the study and imitation
of many modern painters, whose figures are illuminated
by <em>beams unaccountable</em>!</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice for the prints; as to the
book, a pen was not Hogarth's instrument. His life
had been devoted to the study of the pencil; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
however clear in idea, he felt the consciousness that
his language might be rendered more worthy public
attention by the advice and assistance of literary
friends. This he acknowledges, in the style of a man
who felt that his character did not depend on the
power of constructing a sentence, in which branch of
the work he was aided by Doctor Hoadley, Doctor
Morrell, and his friend the Reverend Mr. Townley,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
whose son told me, that when his father corrected the
first sheet, he found a <em>plentiful crop of errors</em>; the
second and third were less incorrect; and the fourth
much more accurate than the preceding. Such is the
power of genius, whatever its direction.</p>

<p>I will not go so far as Mr. Ralph, who says, "that
by means of this volume composition is become a
science; the student knows what he is in search of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the connoisseur what to praise, and fancy or fashion,
or prescription, will usurp the hackneyed name of taste
no more; because I think with Lady Luxborough,
that in the line of beauty no man can literally fix <em>the
precise degree of obliquity</em>;" but I think with the same
lady, "that between his pencil and his pen, he conveys
an idea which enables one to conceive his meaning,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and that he gives many hints which may be of great
use to the artist, actor, dancer, or connoisseur.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Though many profitable opportunities were offered
by the politics of the day, it does not appear that
Hogarth ever degraded his character by either servile
adulation or interested abuse of <em>the powers which
were</em>.</p>

<p>In an account of the March to Finchley, it will be
found that when the print was presented to George <span class="fs70">II.</span>,
the king returned it in a way that must have mortified
and wounded the artist, who, though he was tremblingly
alive to professional indignity, made no <em>graven
retaliation</em>. He could not therefore be considered as
an opponent it was proper to silence, or as an advocate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
it was necessary to retain; notwithstanding
which, on the 16th of July 1757, when Mr. Thornhill
(son to Sir James) resigned his place of sergeant
painter, William Hogarth was appointed his successor;
and very soon after, engaged in a <em>pencil competition</em>
that did not terminate to his advantage.</p>

<p>I have had frequent occasion to mention the opinion
he entertained of <em>ancient paintings</em>. By ridiculing
copies and contemptible originals, he got a habit of
laughing at them all; and when, in 1758, Sir Thomas
Sebright, at Sir Luke Schaub's sale, gave £404, 5s.
for <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Corregio's Sigismunda'">Correggio's Sigismunda</ins>,
<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Hogarth, <em>in evil hour</em>,
asserted that, were he paid as good a price, he could
paint a better picture. Sir Richard (afterwards Lord)
Grosvenor unluckily gave him an order for the same
subject, <em>guarded with the qualifying monosyllable</em> <span class="fs70">IF</span>.
The work was finished,&mdash;sent to the purchaser,&mdash;and
returned to the artist,&mdash;<em>because</em>,&mdash;as the ironical
epistle<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which accompanied it expressed,&mdash;"<em>Contemplating
such a subject must excite melancholy ideas,
which a curtain being drawn before it would not
diminish.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>This rejection produced a letter from Hogarth to a
friend, relating the whole transaction, in rhymes that
might perhaps give our painter a niche amongst the
minor poets; but which, having neither the harmony
of Pope nor the ardour of Dryden, shall find no place
here. The prophecy it concludes with has not been
absolutely fulfilled, but in the form of a <em>wish</em> may be
a suitable motto for the next print.</p>

<div class="caption">SIGISMUNDA.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A competition with either Guido or Furino would
to any modern painter be <em>an enterprise of danger</em>: to
Hogarth it was more peculiarly so, from the public
justly conceiving that the representation of elevated
distress was not his <em>forte</em>, and his being surrounded
by an <em>host of foes</em>, who either dreaded satire or envied
genius. The connoisseurs considering the challenge
as too insolent to be forgiven,&mdash;<em>before his picture
appeared</em>, determined to decry it. The painters
rejoiced in his attempting what was likely to end in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
disgrace; and to satisfy those who had formed their
ideas of Sigismunda upon the inspired page of
Dryden, was no easy task.</p>

<p>The bard has consecrated the character, and his
heroine glitters with a brightness that cannot be
transferred to the canvas. Mr. Walpole's description,
though equally radiant, is too <em>various</em> for the utmost
powers of the pencil.</p>

<p>Hogarth's Sigismunda, as this gentleman poetically
expresses it, "<em>has none of the sober grief, no dignity of
suppressed anguish, no involuntary tear, no settled
meditation on the fate she meant to meet, no amorous
warmth turned holy by despair; in short, all is wanting
that should have been there, all is there that such a
story would have banished from a mind capable of
conceiving such complicated woe; woe so sternly felt,
and yet so tenderly</em>." This glowing picture presents
to the mind a being whose contending passions may
be felt, but were not delineated <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'even by Corregio'">even by Correggio</ins>.
Had his tints been aided by the grace and greatness
of Raphael, they must have failed.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite>Mysterious Mother</cite> sought for
sublimity, where the artist strictly copied nature,
which was invariably his archetype, but which the
painter, who soars into <em>fancy's fairy regions</em>, must
in a degree desert. Considered with this reference,
though the picture has faults, Mr. Walpole's satire
is surely too severe. It is built upon a comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with works painted in a language of which Hogarth
knew not the idiom,&mdash;trying him before a tribunal
whose authority he did not acknowledge; and from
the picture having been in many respects altered
after the critic saw it, some of the remarks become
unfair. To the frequency of these alterations we
may attribute many of the errors:<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the man who has
not confidence in his own knowledge of the leading
principles on which his work ought to be built,
will not render it perfect by following the advice of
his friends. Though Messrs. Wilkes and Churchill
dragged his heroine to the altar of politics, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>mangled her with a barbarity that can hardly be
paralleled, except in the history of her husband,&mdash;the
artist retained his partiality, which seems to
have increased in exact proportion to <em>their</em> abuse.
The picture being thus contemplated through the
medium of party prejudice, we cannot wonder that
all its imperfections were exaggerated. The <em>painted
harlot</em> of Babylon had not more opprobrious epithets
from the <em>first race</em> of reformers, than the <em>painted</em>
Sigismunda of Hogarth from the <em>last race</em> of patriots.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>When a favourite child is chastised by his preceptor,
a partial mother redoubles her caresses.
Hogarth, estimating this picture by the labour he
had bestowed upon it, <em>was certain</em> that the public
were prejudiced, and requested, if his wife survived
him, she would not sell it for less than five hundred
pounds. Mrs. Hogarth acted in conformity to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wishes; but after her death, the painting was
purchased by Messrs. Boydell, and exhibited in the
Shakspeare Gallery. The colouring, though not
brilliant, is harmonious and natural: the attitude,
drawing, etc., may be generally conceived by the print
engraved by Mr. Benjamin Smith. I am much
inclined to think, that if some of those who have
been most severe in their censures, had consulted
their own feelings, instead of depending upon
connoisseurs, poor Sigismunda would have been in
higher estimation. It has been said that the first
sketch was made from Mrs. Hogarth, at the time
she was weeping over the <em>corse</em> of her mother.</p>

<p>Hogarth once intended to have appealed from the
critics' fiat to the world's opinion, and employed Mr.
Basire to make an engraving, which was begun, but
set aside for some other work, and never completed.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">This animated satire was etched as a receipt-ticket
for a print of Sigismunda. It represents <em>Time</em>, seated
upon a mutilated statue, and smoking a landscape,
through which he has driven his scythe, to give proof
of its antiquity,&mdash;not only by <em>sober, sombre</em> tints,
but by an injured canvas. Beneath the easel on
which it is fixed the artist has placed a capacious jar,
on which is written <span class="fs80">VARNISH</span>,&mdash;to <em>bring out</em> the
beauties of this inestimable assemblage of straight
lines. The frame is dignified with a Greek motto:</p>

<p class="pad4">
<em>Crates,&mdash;</em><span title="Ho gar chronos m' ekampse, tektôn men sophos,">Ὁ γὰρ χρόνος μ' ἔκαμψε, τέκτων μὲν σοφὸς,</span><br />

<p class="right fs80">See <cite>Spectator</cite>, vol. ii. p. 83.</p>

<p>This, though not engraved with precise accuracy, is
sufficiently descriptive of the figure.</p>

<p><em>Time has bent me double; and Time, though I confess
he is a great artist, weakens all he touches.</em></p>

<p>"From a contempt" (says Mr. Walpole) "of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ignorant virtuosi of the age, and from indignation at
the impudent tricks of picture-dealers,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> whom he saw
continually recommending and vending vile copies
to bubble-collectors, and from having never studied,
indeed having seen few good pictures of the great
Italian masters, he persuaded himself that the praises
bestowed on those glorious works were nothing but
the effects of prejudice. He talked this language till
he believed it; and having heard it often asserted, as
is true, that Time gives a mellowness to colours, and
improves them, he not only denied the proposition,
but maintained that pictures only grew black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
worse by age, not distinguishing between the degrees
in which the proposition might be true or false."</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Walpole's remarks are right or wrong,
Hogarth has admirably illustrated his own doctrine,
and added to his burlesque, by introducing the fragments
of a statue, below which is written,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">As statues moulder into worth. &nbsp; P. W.</p>
</div></div>

<p>By part of this print being in <em>mezzotinto</em> and the
remainder etched, it has a singularly striking and
spirited appearance.</p>

<p>Hogarth, the following year, published that admirable
satire, <cite>The Medley</cite>, which completely refutes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
reproach thrown on his <em>declining talents</em> by his
political opponents, whose violent, and in some respects
vindictive attack, is erroneously said to have
hastened his death. That he was <em>wounded</em> with a
barbed spear, hurled by the hand of a friend, it is
reasonable to suppose; but armed with the <em>mailed
coat</em> of conscious superiority, he could not be <em>wounded
mortally</em>. What!&mdash;<em>broken-hearted by a rhyme!</em>&mdash;<em>pelted
to death with ballads!</em>&mdash;He was too proud!
I am told by those who knew him best, that the little
mortification he felt, did not arise from the severity of
the satire, but from a recollection of the terms on
which he had lived with the satirist.</p>

<p>To the painter's recriminations in this party jar,
Mr. Nichols I suppose alludes, page 97 of his Anecdotes,
where he says, that "<em>in his political conduct and
attachments, Hogarth was at once unprincipled and
variable</em>." These are harsh and heavy charges, but I
am to learn on what they are founded. He never
embarked with any party, nor did he publish a
political print before the year 1762; and the principles
he there professes he retained until his death.</p>

<p>In the same page of the Anecdotes, I find, after a
complimentary quotation from one of Mr. Hayley's
poems, several severe strictures to which I cannot
assent.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The assertion, that <em>all his powers of delighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
were confined to his pencil</em>, is in a degree refuted
by the Analysis. That <em>he was rarely admitted into
polite circles</em>, I can readily believe; but if by <em>polite
circles</em>, Mr. Nichols means those persons of honour
who deem <em>dress</em> the grand criterion of distinction,
think making <em>an easy bow</em> the first human acquirement,
and Lord Chesterfield's code <em>the whole duty of
man</em>,&mdash;the artist had no great cause to regret the loss
of such society. But <em>his sharp corners not being rubbed
off</em> by collision with these polite circles, he was, <em>to the
last, a gross, uncultivated man</em>. Engaged in ascertaining
the principles of his art, he had not leisure to
study the <em>principles of politeness</em>; but by those who
lived with him in habits of intimacy, I am told he
was by no means gross.</p>

<p>"<em>To be member of a club consisting of mechanics, or
those not many degrees above them, seems to have been
the utmost of his social ambition.</em>"&mdash;Yet we find in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
list of his social companions, Fielding, Hoadley,
Garrick, Townley, and many other names who were
an honour to their age and country. Though excluded
from <em>polite circles</em>, by these and such men he
was received as a friend. Some of his evenings were
probably passed among his neighbours, and being
above dissimulation, I suppose he resented what he
disliked, and was, as Mr. Nichols informs us, often
<em>sent to Coventry</em>. "<em>He is said to have beheld the rising
eminence and popularity of Sir Joshua Reynolds with
a degree of envy; and, if I am not misinformed, spoke
with asperity both of him and his performances.</em>" It
has been said, and I believe with equal truth, that
Rubens <em>envied</em> the rising eminence and popularity of
Vandyke: neither the Englishman nor the Fleming
were capable of so mean a passion. The walk of
William Hogarth was diametrically opposite to that
of Sir Joshua Reynolds. They saw nature through a
different medium: one of them almost invariably
dignifies his characters; whilst the other, from the
nature of his subjects, sinks, and in some measure
degrades them. The man whose portrait is painted
by the President feels exalted; whilst he who looks in
the mirror displayed by Hogarth, finds a resemblance
better calculated to gratify his <em>good-natured friends</em>
than himself. These circumstances considered, I can
conceive Hogarth might have been pleased if he
could have united the elegance of Sir Joshua to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
own humour, and that the knight might be proud
of adding the powers of Hogarth to his own taste,
without either of them possessing a particle of the
diabolical passion alluded to by Mr. Nichols, who
thus winds up the character: "<em>Justice, however,
obliges me to add, that our artist was liberal, hospitable,
and the most punctual of paymasters.</em>" This is fair and
unequivocal praise,&mdash;but justice obliges <em>me</em> to add,
seems given <em>upon compulsion</em>. <em>Why</em> the biographer
feels so much reluctance at being <em>thus obliged</em> to
commend the hero of his own history, we are not
told,&mdash;though the cause of a lady being most <em>indecently
caricatured</em>, is, in the same book, frankly
acknowledged.</p>

<p>"<em>She is still living, and has been loud in abuse of
this work, a circumstance to which she owes a niche in
it!</em>"&mdash;Nichols' <cite>Anecdotes</cite>, p. 114.</p>

<p>Hogarth, with all the indelicacy of which he is
accused, would have blushed at the perusal of this
overcharged character. Though <em>nothing fastidious</em>, I
cannot quote so disgusting a combination of abominable
images. In page 59 we are presented with a
series equally delectable.</p>

<p>Mr. Walpole remarks that the Flemish painters,
as writers of farce and editors of burlesque nature,
are the <em>Tom Brownes</em> of the mob; and in their
attempts at humour, when they intend to make us
laugh, make us sick; that Hogarth resembles Butler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&mdash;amidst
all his pleasantry, observes the true end
of comedy, <span class="fs80">REFORMATION</span>, and has always a moral.
To prove this truth, is one great object of these
volumes. But Mr. Nichols, thinking it necessary to
<em>examine whether the scenes painted by our countryman
are wholly free from Flemish indelicacies</em>, has with
laudable industry culled some sixteen or eighteen
<em>delicious</em> examples, to convince us that they are not.
<em>I omit the catalogue</em>; yet let me be permitted to
suggest, that without the aid of <em>a commentary</em>, these
indelicacies are not generally obtrusive. I once knew
a very grave and profound critic, who employed
several years of his life in collecting all Shakspeare's
<em>double entendres</em>; these he intended for <em>publication</em>, to
<em>prove</em> that his plays were not fit for the <em>public</em> eye,
but was prevented, by a friend suggesting that it
would be thought he had acted like the birds&mdash;<em>pecked
at that fruit which he liked best</em>.</p>

<p>Leaving these and all other indecencies to the contemplation
of those <em>who seek for them</em>, let us return to
our narrative.</p>

<p>Finding his health in a declining state, Hogarth had
some years before purchased a small house at Chiswick.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
To this he retired during the summer months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
but so active a mind could never <em>rust in idleness</em>;&mdash;even
there he pursued his profession, and employed
the last years of his life in retouching and superintending
some repairs and alterations in his plates.
From this place he, on the 25th October 1764, returned
to Leicester Square, and though weak and
languid, retained his usual flow of spirits; but being
on the same night taken suddenly ill, died of an
<em>aneurism</em>, in the arms of his friend Mrs. Lewis, who
was called up to his assistance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis, soon after the death of her friend, on
condition of receiving an annuity for life, transferred
to Messrs. Boydell her right in all the plates; and
since in their possession, they have not been touched
upon by a <em>burin</em>. It may be proper to add, that every
plate has been carefully cleaned; and the rolling-presses
now in use being on an improved principle, the
paper superior, and the art of printing better understood,
impressions are more clearly and accurately
taken off than they have been at any preceding period.</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice for the state of his plates:
their general intention and execution is the proper
basis on which to build his</p>

<p class="p1 pfs90">CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Were it considered by a connoisseur, he would probably
assert that this man could not be a painter, for
he had never travelled to Rome; could not be a
judge of art, for he spoke irreverently of the ancients;
gave his figures neither dignity nor grace; was
erroneous in his distribution of light and shade, and
inattentive to the painter's balance; that his grouping
was inartificial, and his engraving coarse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>To traverse continents in search of antique paintings,
explore caverns for mutilated sculpture, and
measure the proportions of a statue with mathematical
precision, was not the boast of William Hogarth.
The <em>Temple of Nature</em> was his academy, and his
topography the map of the human mind. Disdaining
to copy or translate, he left the superior class of
beings that people the canvas of Poussin and Michael
Angelo to their admirers; selected his images from
his own country, and gave them with a truth, energy,
and variety of character,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> ever appropriate, and invariably
original. Considering his peculiar powers,
it is fortunate for his fame that he was a native of
Britain. In Switzerland, the scenery is romantic,&mdash;the
rocks are stupendous; in Italy, the models of art
are elevated and majestic,&mdash;the ruins of ancient
Greece still continue a school of architecture and proportion;&mdash;but
in England, and in England alone, we
have every variety of character that separates man
from man. To these he resorted, and rarely attempted
to <em>heighten nature</em>, either by ideal or elevated
beauty; for though he had the eye, he had not the
wing of an eagle; when he attempted to soar, particles
of his native clay clung to his pinions, and retarded
his flight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>His engravings, though coarse, are forcible in a
degree scarcely to be paralleled. Every figure is
drawn from the quarry of nature; and, though seldom
polished, is always animated.</p>

<p>He has been accused of grossness in some of his
single figures: but the general vein of his wit is better
calculated to make the man of humour smile than
the humourist laugh;&mdash;has the air of Cervantes
rather than Rabelais,&mdash;of Fielding rather than
Smollett.</p>

<p>I do not know in what class to place his pictured
stories. They are too much crowded with little incidents
for the dignity of history; for tragedy, are too
comic; yet have a termination which forbids us to
call them comedies. Being selected from life, they
present to us the absurdities, crimes, punishments,
and vicissitudes of man: to-day, basking in the bright
beams of prosperity; to-morrow, sunk in the gloom
of comfortless despair. Be it recorded to his honour,
that their invariable tendency is the promotion of
virtue, and the diffusion of such a spirit as tends to
make men industrious, humane, and happy. If some
of the incidents are thought too ludicrous, and a few
of the scenes rather border on the licentious, let it
be remembered, that since they were engraved the
<em>standard of delicacy</em> has been somewhat altered: that
species of wit which this sentimental and <em>double-refined</em>
age deems too much debased for common currency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
was then, with a still larger portion of alloy, the
sterling coin of the kingdom.</p>

<p>On canvas he was not so successful as on copper.
Scripture history, which was one of his first attempts,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
did not add a leaf to his laurel. In small portraits of
conversations, etc., he was somewhat more successful;
but in a few years the novelty wore off, and the
public grew tired. Though he had great facility<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and
general success in his resemblances, his eye was too
correct and his hand too faithful for those who wished
to be flattered. The fantastic fluttering robes, given
by contemporary painters, were too absurd for him
to imitate; and he painted all his figures in the exact
habits they wore. Compared with the dignified
dresses of Vandyke, the Germanic garb, which then
prevailed, gave a mean and unpicturesque formality
to his portraits.</p>

<p>With respect to his person, though hardly to be
classed as a little man, Hogarth was rather below the
middle size; he had an eye peculiarly bright and
piercing, and an air of spirit and vivacity. From an
accident in his youth, he had a deep scar on his forehead:
the mark remained; and he frequently wore
his hat so as to display it. His conversation was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>lively and cheerful,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> mixed with a quickness of retort
that did not gain him friends. Severe in his satire
on those who were present, but of the absent he was
usually the advocate;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and has sometimes boasted
that he never uttered a sentence concerning any man
living, that he would not repeat to his face. In the
relations of husband, brother, friend, and master, he
was kind, generous, sincere, and indulgent. In diet
abstemious; but in his hospitalities, though devoid
of ostentation, liberal and free-hearted. Not parsimonious,
yet frugal;&mdash;but so comparatively small
were the rewards then paid to artists, that, after the
labour of a long life, he left a very inconsiderable sum
to his widow, with whom he must have received a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>large portion of what was bequeathed to her.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> His
character, and the illustrations I have attempted, are
built upon a diligent examination of his prints: if in
any case it should be thought that they have biassed
my judgment, I can truly say that they have informed
it. From them I have learnt much which I should
not otherwise have known, and to inspecting them
I owe many very happy hours. Considering their
originality, variety, and truth, if we take from the
artist all that he <em>is said</em> to have wanted, he will have
more left than has been often the portion of man.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">The general aim of historical painters has
been to emblazon some signal exploit of
an exalted and distinguished character.
To go through a series of actions, and conduct their
hero from the cradle to the grave, to give a history
upon canvas, and tell a story with the pencil, few of
them attempted. Mr. Hogarth saw with the intuitive
eye of genius, that one path to the temple of Fame
was yet untrodden: he took Nature for his guide,
and gained the summit. He was the painter of
nature; for he gave not merely the ground-plan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the countenance, but marked the features with every
impulse of the mind. He may be denominated the
biographical dramatist of domestic life. Leaving
those heroic monarchs who have blazed through their
day with the destructive brilliancy of a comet to
their adulatory historians, he, like Lillo, has taken his
scenes from humble life, and rendered them a source
of entertainment, instruction, and morality.</p>

<p>This series of prints gives the history of a Prostitute.
The story commences with her arrival in
London, where, initiated in the school of profligacy,
she experiences the miseries consequent to her situation,
and dies in the morning of life. Her variety of
wretchedness forms such a picture of the way in which
vice rewards her votaries, as ought to warn the young
and inexperienced from entering this path of infamy.
The first scene of this domestic tragedy is laid at
the Bell Inn, in Wood Street, and the heroine may
possibly be daughter to the poor old clergyman who
is reading the direction of a letter close to the York
waggon, from which vehicle she has just alighted.
In attire, neat, plain, unadorned; in demeanour,
artless, modest, diffident; in the bloom of youth,
and more distinguished by native innocence than
elegant symmetry; her conscious blush and downcast
eyes attract the attention of a female fiend who
panders to the vices of the opulent and libidinous.
Coming out of the door of the inn we discover two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>men, one of whom is eagerly gloating on the devoted
victim. This is a portrait, and said to be a strong
resemblance of Colonel Francis Chartres,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> whose
epitaph was written by Doctor Arbuthnot: in that
epitaph his character is most emphatically described.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The old procuress, immediately after the girl's
alighting from the waggon, addresses her with the
familiarity of a friend rather than the reserve of one
who is to be her mistress.</p>

<p>Had her father been versed in even the first rudiments
of physiognomy, he would have prevented her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>engaging with one of so decided an aspect; for this
also is the portrait of a woman infamous in her day:<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
but he, good, easy man, unsuspicious as Fielding's
Parson Adams, is wholly engrossed in the contemplation
of a superscription to a letter addressed to the
bishop of the diocese. So important an object prevents
his attending to his daughter, or regarding the
devastation occasioned by his gaunt and hungry
Rozinante having snatched at the straw that packs up
some earthenware, and produced</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"The wreck of flower-pots, and the crash of pans!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>From the inn she is taken to the house of the procuress,
divested of her home-spun garb, dressed in the
gayest style of the day, and the tender native hue of
her complexion encrusted with paint and disguised
by patches. She is then introduced to Colonel
Chartres, and by artful flattery and liberal promises
becomes intoxicated with the dreams of imaginary
greatness. A short time convinces her of how light a
breath these promises were composed. Deserted by
her keeper, and terrified by threats of an immediate
arrest for the pompous paraphernalia of prostitution,
after being a short time protected by one of the tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of Levi, she is reduced to the hard necessity of
wandering the streets for that precarious subsistence
which flows from the drunken rake or profligate
debauchee. Here her situation is truly pitiable!
Chilled by nipping frost and midnight dew, the
repentant tear trickling on her heaving bosom, she
endeavours to drown reflection in draughts of destructive
poison. This, added to the contagious
company of women of her own description, vitiates
her mind, eradicates the native seeds of virtue, destroys
that elegant and fascinating simplicity which
gives additional charms to beauty, and leaves in its
place art, affectation, and impudence.</p>

<p>Neither the painter of a sublime picture nor the
writer of an heroic poem should introduce any
trivial circumstances that are likely to draw the
attention from the principal figures. Such compositions
should form one great whole: minute detail will
inevitably weaken their effect. But in little stories
which record the domestic incidents of familiar life,
these accessory accompaniments, though trifling in
themselves, acquire a consequence from their situation;
they add to the interest, and realize the scene.
In this, as in almost all that were delineated by Mr.
Hogarth, we see a close regard paid to things as they
then were; by which means his prints become a sort
of historical record of the manners of the age.</p>

<p>The balcony, with linen hanging to dry; the York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
waggon, which intimates the county that gave birth
to our young adventurer; parcels lying on the ground,
and a goose, directed <em>To my lofen coosin in Tems Stret
London</em>, prove the peculiar attention he paid to the
<em>minutiæ</em>. The initials M. H. on one of the trunks
give us the name of the heroine of this drama,&mdash;Hackabout
was a character then well known, and infamous
for her licentiousness and debauchery.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Of elegant beauty Mr. Hogarth had not much idea;
but he has marked his heroine with natural simplicity.
To the old procuress he has given her physiognomical
distinction, and to the Colonel his appropriate stamp.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Entered into the path of infamy, the next scene
exhibits our young heroine the mistress of a rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Jew, attended by a black boy,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and surrounded with
the pompous parade of tasteless profusion. Her
mind being now as depraved as her person is
decorated, she keeps up the spirit of her character
by extravagance and inconstancy. An example of
the first is exhibited in the monkey being suffered
to drag her rich head-dress round the room, and of
the second in the retiring gallant. The Hebrew
is represented at breakfast with his mistress; but
having come earlier than was expected, the favourite
has not departed. To secure his retreat, is an exercise
for the invention of both mistress and maid.
This is accomplished by the lady finding a pretence
for quarrelling with the Jew, kicking down the tea-table,
and scalding his legs, which, added to the noise
of the china, so far engrosses his attention, that the
paramour, assisted by the servant, escapes discovery.</p>

<p>The subjects of two pictures with which the room
is decorated are, David dancing before the ark, and
Jonah seated under a gourd.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> They are placed there,
not merely as circumstances which belong to Jewish
story, but as a piece of covert ridicule on the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>masters, who generally painted from the ideas of
others, and repeated the same tale <em>ad infinitum</em>. On
the toilet-table we discover a mask, which well enough
intimates where she had passed part of the preceding
night, and that masquerades, then a very fashionable
amusement, were much frequented by women of this
description; a sufficient reason for their being avoided
by those of an opposite character.</p>

<p>Under the protection of this disciple of Moses she
could not remain long. Riches were his only attraction,
and though profusely lavished on this unworthy
object, her attachment was not to be obtained, nor
could her constancy be secured; repeated acts of
infidelity are punished by dismission; and her next
situation shows that, like most of the sisterhood, she
had lived without apprehension of the sunshine of
life being darkened by the passing cloud, and made
no provision for the hour of adversity.</p>

<p>In this print the characters are marked with a
master's hand. The insolent air of the harlot, the
astonishment of the Jew,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> eagerly grasping at the
falling table, the start of the black boy, the cautious
trip of the <em>ungartered</em> and <em>barefooted</em> retreating gallant,
and the sudden spring of the scalded monkey, are
admirably expressed. To represent an object in its
descent has been said to be impossible: the attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
has seldom succeeded; but in this print, the tea
equipage really appears falling to the floor.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">We here see this child of misfortune fallen from her
high estate! Her magnificent apartment is quitted
for a dreary lodging in the purlieus of Drury Lane:
she is at breakfast, and every object exhibits marks
of the most wretched penury; her silver tea-kettle is
changed for a tin-pot, and her highly-decorated toilet
gives place to an old leaf-table, strewed with the
relics of the last night's revel, and ornamented with
a broken looking-glass. Around the room are scattered
tobacco-pipes, gin measures, and pewter pots,&mdash;emblems
of the habits of life into which she is
initiated, and the company which she now keeps:
this is further intimated by the wig-box of James
Dalton, a notorious street-robber, who was afterwards
executed. In her hand she displays a watch, which
might be either presented to her, or stolen from her
last night's gallant. By the nostrums which ornament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the broken window, we see that poverty is not her
only evil. The dreary and comfortless appearance of
every object in this wretched receptacle, the bit of
butter on a piece of paper,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the candle in a bottle, the
basin upon a chair, the punch-bowl and comb upon
the table, and the tobacco-pipes, etc. strewed upon
the unswept floor, give an admirable picture of the
style in which this pride of Drury Lane ate her
matin meal. The pictures which ornament the room
are, Abraham offering up Isaac, and a portrait of
the Virgin Mary; Dr. Sacheverell<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and Macheath
the highwayman are companion prints. There is
some whimsicality in placing the two ladies under a
canopy,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> formed by the unnailed valance of the bed,

correction, where our legislators wisely suppose, that
being confined to the improving conversation of her
associates in vice, must have a powerful tendency
towards the reformation of her manners!</p>

<p class="noindent">The situation in which the last plate exhibited our
wretched female was sufficiently degrading, but in
this her misery is greatly aggravated. We now see
her suffering the chastisement due to her follies;
reduced to the wretched alternative of beating hemp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
or receiving the correction of a savage taskmaster.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Exposed to the derision of all around, even her own
servant, who is well acquainted with the rules of the
place, appears little disposed to show any return of
gratitude for recent obligations, though even her
shoes, which she displays while tying up her garter,
seem by their gaudy outside to have been a present
from her mistress. The civil discipline of the stern
keeper has all the severity of the old school.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> With
the true spirit of tyranny, he sentences those who will
not labour to the whipping post, to a kind of picketing
suspension by the wrists, or having a heavy log fastened
to their leg. With the last of these punishments he
at this moment threatens the heroine of our story;
nor is it likely that his obduracy can be softened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>except by a well-applied fee. How dreadful, how
mortifying the situation! These accumulated evils
might perhaps produce a momentary remorse, but a
return to the path of virtue is not so easy as a departure
from it. The Magdalen hospital has been
since instituted, and the wandering female sometimes
finds it an asylum from wretchedness, and a refuge
from the reproaches of the world.</p>

<p>To show that neither the dread nor endurance of
the severest punishment will deter from the perpetration
of crimes, a one-eyed female, close to the keeper,
is picking a pocket. The torn card may probably
be dropped by the well-dressed gamester, who has
exchanged the dice-box for the mallet, and whose
laced hat is hung up as a companion trophy to the
hoop-petticoat.</p>

<p>One of the girls appears scarcely in her teens. To
the disgrace of our police, these unfortunate little
wanderers are still suffered to take their nocturnal
rambles in the most public streets of the metropolis.
What heart so void of sensibility as not to heave a
pitying sigh at their deplorable situation? Vice is
not confined to colour, for a <em>black</em> woman is ludicrously
exhibited as suffering the penalty of those frailties
which are imagined peculiar to the <em>fair</em>.</p>

<p>The figure chalked as dangling upon the wall, with
a pipe in his mouth, is intended as a caricatured
portrait of Sir John Gonson, and probably the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>duction
of some <em>wou'd-be artist</em> whom the magistrate
had committed to Bridewell as a proper <em>academy</em> for
the pursuit of his studies. The inscription upon the
pillory, <span class="fs80">BETTER TO WORK THAN STAND THUS</span>, and
that on the whipping-post, near the laced gambler,
<span class="fs80">THE REWARD OF IDLENESS</span>, are judiciously introduced.</p>

<p>In this print the composition is tolerably good: the
figures in the background, though properly subordinate,
sufficiently marked; the lassitude of the principal
character well contrasted by the austerity of the
rigid overseer. There is a fine climax of female
debasement, from the gaudy heroine of our drama to
her maid, and from thence to the still lower object
who is represented as <em>destroying</em><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> one of the plagues

and each charging the other with having poisoned her.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
While the maid-servant is entreating them to cease
quarrelling, and assist her dying mistress, the nurse
plunders her trunk of the few poor remains of former
grandeur. Her little boy turning a scanty remnant of
meat hung to roast by a string; the linen hanging to
dry; the coals deposited in a corner; the candles, bellows,
and gridiron hung upon nails; the furniture of
the room, and indeed every accompaniment, exhibit
a dreary display of poverty and wretchedness. Over
the candles hangs a cake of Jew's bread, once perhaps
the property of her Levitical lover, and now used
as a fly-trap. The initials of her name, M. H., are
smoked upon the ceiling as a kind of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento mori</i>
to the next inhabitant. On the floor lies a paper
inscribed <span class="fs80">ANODYNE NECKLACE</span>, at that time deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a sort of <span class="fs80">CHARM</span> against the disorders incident to
children;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and near the fire, a tobacco-pipe and
paper of pills.</p>

<p>A picture of general, and, at this awful moment, indecent
confusion, is admirably represented. The noise
of two enraged quacks disputing in bad English, the
harsh vulgar scream of the maid-servant, the table
falling, and the pot boiling over, must produce a combination
of sounds dreadful and dissonant to the ear.
In this pitiable situation, without a friend to close her
dying eyes or soften her sufferings by a tributary
tear,&mdash;forlorn, destitute, and deserted,&mdash;the heroine of
this eventful history expires; her premature death
brought on by a licentious life, seven years of which
had been devoted to debauchery and dissipation, and
attended by consequent infamy, misery, and disease.
The whole story affords a valuable lesson to the
young and inexperienced, and proves this great, this
important truth, that <span class="fs80">A DEVIATION FROM VIRTUE IS
A DEPARTURE FROM HAPPINESS</span>.</p>

<p>The emaciated appearance of the dying figure, the
boy's thoughtless inattention, and the rapacious, unfeeling
eagerness of the old nurse, are naturally and
forcibly delineated.</p>

<p>The figures are well grouped; the curtain gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
depth, and forms a good background to the doctor's
head; the light is judiciously distributed, and each
accompaniment highly appropriate.</p>

<div class="caption">THE HARLOT'S PROGRESS, PLATE VI.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The adventures of our heroine are now concluded.
She is no longer an actor in her own tragedy; and
there are those who have considered this print as a
farce at the end of it: but surely such was not the
author's intention.</p>

<p>The ingenious writer of <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite> begins
the life of his hero before he is born; the picturesque
biographer of Mary Hackabout has found an opportunity
to convey admonition, and enforce his moral,
after her death. A wish usually prevails, even among
those who are most humbled by their own indiscretion,
that some respect should be paid to their
remains; that their eyes should be closed by the
tender hand of a surviving friend, and the tear of
sympathy and regret shed upon the sod which covers
their grave; that those who loved them living should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
attend their last sad obsequies, and a sacred character
read over them the awful service which our religion
ordains with the solemnity it demands. The memory
of this votary of prostitution meets with no such
marks of social attention or pious respect. The
preparations for her funeral are as licentious as the
progress of her life, and the contagion of her example
seems to reach all who surround her coffin. One of
them is engaged in the double trade of seduction and
thievery; a second is contemplating her own face in a
mirror. The female who is gazing at the corpse displays
some marks of concern, and feels a momentary
compunction at viewing the melancholy scene before
her: but if any other part of the company are in a
degree affected, it is a mere maudlin sorrow, kept
up by glasses of strong liquor. The depraved priest
does not seem likely to feel for the dead that hope
expressed in our liturgy.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The appearance and
employment of almost every one present at this
mockery of woe, is such as must raise disgust in the
breast of any female who has the least tincture of
delicacy, and excite a wish that such an exhibition
may not be displayed at her own funeral.</p>

<p>In this plate there are some local customs which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>mark the manners of the times when it was engraved,
but are now generally disused, except in some of the
provinces very distant from the capital; sprigs of
rosemary were then given to each of the mourners:
to appear at a funeral without one, was as great an
indecorum as to be without a white handkerchief.
This custom might probably originate at a time when
the plague depopulated the metropolis, and rosemary
was deemed an antidote against contagion. It must
be acknowledged that there are also in this print
some things which, though they gave the artist an opportunity
of displaying his humour, are violations of
propriety and custom: such is her child, but a few
removes from infancy, being habited as chief mourner,
to attend his parent to the grave; rings presented,
and an escutcheon hung up in a garret at the funeral
of a needy prostitute.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The whole may be intended
as a burlesque upon ostentatious and expensive
funerals, which were then more customary than they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
are now. Mr. Pope has well ridiculed the same
folly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"When Hopkins dies, a thousand lights attend</p>
<p class="verse">The wretch who, living, saved a candle's end."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The figures have much characteristic discrimination:
the woman looking into the coffin has more beauty
than we generally see in the works of this artist.
The undertaker's gloating stare, his companion's leer,
the internal satisfaction of the parson and his next
neighbour, are contrasted by the Irish howl of the
woman at the opposite side, and evince Mr. Hogarth's
thorough knowledge of the operation of the passions
upon the features. The composition forms a good
shape, has a proper depth, and the light is well
managed.</p>

<p>Sir James Thornhill's opinion of this series may
be inferred from the following circumstance. Mr.
Hogarth had without consent married his daughter:
Sir James, considering him as an obscure artist, was
much displeased with the connection. To give him a
better opinion of his son-in-law, a common friend one
morning privately conveyed the six pictures of the
"Harlot's Progress" into his drawing-room. The
veteran painter eagerly inquired who was the artist;
and being told, cried out, "Very well! Very well
indeed! The man who can paint such pictures as
these, can maintain a wife without a portion." This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was the remark of the moment; but he afterwards
considered the union of his daughter with a man of
such abilities an honour to his family, was reconciled,
and generous.</p>

<p>When the publication was advertised, such was the
expectation of the town, that above twelve hundred
names were entered in the subscription book. When
the prints appeared, they were beheld with astonishment.
A subject so novel in the idea, so marked
with genius in the execution, excited the most eager
attention of the public. At a time when England
was coldly inattentive to everything which related to
the arts, so desirous were all ranks of people of seeing
how this little domestic story was delineated, that
there were eight piratical imitations,&mdash;besides two
copies in a smaller size than the original, published,
by permission of the author, for Thomas Bakewell.
The whole series were copied on fan-mounts, representing
the six plates, three on one side, and three
on the other. It was transferred from the copper to
the stage, in the form of a pantomime, by Theophilus
Cibber; and again represented in a ballad opera,
entitled, The Jew Decoyed, or the Harlot's Progress.</p>

<p>A Joseph Gay, and several other wretched rhymers,
published what they called poetical illustrations of
Mr. Hogarth's six plates: but these effusions of dulness
do not deserve enumeration; nor would they
deserve mention, but as collateral proofs of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
estimation in which these prints were held, when
their popularity could force the sale of such miserable
productions. Happily they are now consigned to
those two high priests of the temple of oblivion, the
trunkmaker and the pastrycook.</p>

<p>The six original pictures were sold on the 25th of
January 1744-5, and produced eighty-eight pounds
four shillings. Mr. Beckford, a late Lord Mayor of
London, was, I believe, the purchaser. At a fire
which burnt down his house at Fonthill, Wiltshire,
in the year 1755, five of them were consumed.</p>

<p>When a messenger brought him intelligence of this
unfortunate event, he said nothing, but took out his
pocket-book, and wrote down a number of figures,
which he seemed inspecting with the cool precision
of a true disciple of Cocker, when a friend who was
present, expressing some surprise at his being so collected
after so heavy a loss, asked him what was the
subject of his meditation? to which he answered, with
the most philosophical indifference, "I am calculating
how much it will cost me to rebuild my house."</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In the last series of prints Mr. Hogarth delineated,
with a master's hand, the miseries
attendant upon a female's deviation from
virtue. In this he presents to us the picture of a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
man, thoughtless, extravagant, and licentious; and,
in colours equally impressive, paints the destructive
consequences of his conduct. The first print most
forcibly contrasts two opposite passions,&mdash;the unthinking
negligence of youth, and the sordid avaricious
rapacity of age. It brings into one point of
view what Mr. Pope so exquisitely describes in his
Epistle to Lord Bathurst:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Who sees pale Mammon pine amidst his store,</p>
<p class="verse">Sees but a backward steward for the poor;</p>
<p class="verse">This year a reservoir, to keep and spare;</p>
<p class="verse">The next a fountain, spouting through his heir."</p>
</div></div>

<p>It represents a young man taking possession of a
rich miser's effects, and is crowded with the monuments
of departed avarice. Everything, valuable
or not valuable, has been hoarded. A chest of old
plate, an old coat, a worn-out boot, and the caul
of a periwig, are preserved with equal care. The
thread-bare garments are hung up; the rusty spur
put into a closet; and even a spectacle-frame, without
glasses, is thought worthy of preservation. The contents
of his armoury are curious, and valuable as the
lumbering furniture of his room: they consist of two
swords, which may be considered as trophies of his
youthful prowess, or protectors of his cankered pelf.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
The crutch and walking-stick, those unequal supporters
of his feeble frame, now lean unheeded against
the wall. His fur cap and greatcoat seem to have
been winter substitutes for fire, as the grate in which
a withered <em>Sibyl</em> is laying wood has no marks of even
a remaining cinder. The remnant of candle in a
save-all, the Jack taken down as an useless piece of
furniture, and, with the spit, hoisted into a high cupboard,
give strong indications of the manner in which
this votary of Mammon existed, for such a being could
scarcely be said to live. The gaunt appearance of an
half-starved cat proves not only the rigid abstinence
practised by this wretched slave to his wealth, but
that in his miserable mansion</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"No mouse e'er lurk'd, no rat e'er sought for food."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The iron-bound chests, the hidden gold falling from
the breaking cornice, and indeed every article that is
displayed in this dreary tomb of buried wealth, give
additional marks of a suspicious and sordid disposition.
The picture of a miser counting his gold; the
escutcheons, those gloomy ornaments of departed
wretchedness, with the armorial bearings of avarice,
three vices hard screwed, are adjuncts highly appropriate
to the place; the motto, <span class="fs80">BEWARE</span>, inscribed
under the arms, is a well-directed caution, and ought
to be seriously considered by those who feel a propensity
to this meanest of passions. An old shoe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
soled with the cover of a Bible, and the little memorandum,
<em>May 5th, 1721, put off my bad shilling</em>,
are strong proofs that extreme avarice destroys all
reverence for religion, and eradicates every principle
of honesty.</p>

<p>The introduction to this history is well delineated,
and the principal figure marked with that easy, unmeaning
vacancy of face which speaks him formed by
nature for a <span class="fs80">DUPE</span>. Ignorant of the value of money,
and negligent in his nature, he leaves his bag of
untold gold in the reach of an old and greedy pettifogging
attorney,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> who is making an inventory of
bonds, mortgages, indentures, etc. This man, with the
rapacity so natural to his profession, seizes the first
opportunity of plundering his employer. Hogarth
had a few years before been engaged in a lawsuit,
which gave him some experience of the <span class="fs80">PRACTICE</span>
of those pests of society.</p>

<p>The figure of the young woman with a wedding-ring
is not alluring, neither is her face attractive; but
her being pregnant, and accompanied by her mother
with an apron full of letters, gives her a claim to our
pity, as it clearly intimates that this is meant as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
visit to entreat the promised hand of her seducer;
but he violates every former protestation, refuses her
marriage, and attempts by a bribe to get a release
from the obligation. Her mother violently reproaches
him for his conduct, and invokes the curses of offended
Heaven upon his falsehood.</p>

<p>In this print the drawing and disposition of the
figures are tolerably good, the light is properly distributed,
and the perspective accurately represented;
but the whole wants <em>mass</em>. To display the hoards,
it was necessary to open the boxes and doors; and
though an exhibition of the heterogeneous collection
heaped together by this wretched defrauder of himself
most forcibly describes the disposition of the
man, it hurts the <em>repose</em> of the picture. Breaking
the background into so many parts, destroys that
breadth which ought to be considered as a leading
excellence.</p>

<p class="noindent">The sordid avarice of the wretched miser is in this
print contrasted by the giddy profusion of his prodigal
heir. The old man pined in the midst of plenty,
starved while surrounded by abundance, and refused
himself enjoyment of the absolute necessaries of life
from an apprehension of future poverty.</p>

<p>Three years have elapsed, and our giddy spendthrift,
throwing of the awkwardness of a rustic,
assumes the character and apes the manners of a
modern fine gentleman. To qualify himself for performing
the part, he is attended by a French tailor, a
milliner, a Parisian dancing-master,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a Gallic fencing-master,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
an English prize-fighter,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and a teacher of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>music.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Besides this crowd of masters of arts, he has

of gardens,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> a bravo,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> a jockey,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and a poet! the latter
having written a panegyric in honour of this exalted
character, already anticipates approbation and reward.
Surrounded by such a multitude of attentive friends
and warm admirers, the dissolution of his fortune
is inevitable; it must melt like snow beneath the
solar beam.</p>

<p>How exactly does Bramston describe the character
in his <cite>Man of Taste</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Without Italian, and without an ear,</p>
<p class="verse">To Bononcini's music I adhere.</p>
<p class="verse">To boon companions I my time would give,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<p class="verse">With players, pimps, and parasites I'd live;</p>
<p class="verse">I would with jockeys from Newmarket dine,</p>
<p class="verse">And to rough riders give my choicest wine.</p>
<p class="verse">My evenings all I would with sharpers spend,</p>
<p class="verse">And make the thief-taker my bosom friend;</p>
<p class="verse">In Figg the prize-fighter by day delight,</p>
<p class="verse">And sup with Colley Cibber every night."</p>
</div></div>

<p>On the back of the musician's chair hangs a list of
presents which Farinelli, an Italian singer, received
the day after his performance of a favourite character
at the Opera House. Among others, a gold snuff-box,
chased with the story of Orpheus charming the
brutes, from T. Rakewell, Esq.</p>

<p>Another memento of musical extravagance is the
frontispiece to a poem lying on the floor, and dedicated
to Esquire Rakewell, in which the ladies of
Great Britain are represented as sacrificing their
hearts to this idol of sound, and crying out with great
earnestness, One God, one Farinelli! This intimates
the violent rage of the fashionable world for that most
frivolous of all amusements, the Italian Opera. The
taste which our prodigal has imbibed for the turf is
pointed out by the jockey presenting a silver punch-bowl,
which one of his horses is supposed to have
won; his passion for another royal amusement, by
the portraits of two fighting-cocks, hung up as the
ornaments of his saloon. A picture which he has
placed between them bears a whimsical allusion; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
is the "Judgment of Paris."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The figures in the
background consist of such persons as are general
attendants in the ante-chamber of a dissipated man
of fashion. The whole is a high-wrought satire on
those men of rank and fortune whose follies render
them a prey to the artful and rapacious.</p>

<p>Of the expression in this print we cannot speak
more highly than it deserves. Every character is
marked with its proper and discriminative stamp. It
has been said by a very judicious critic,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> from whom
it is not easy to differ without being wrong, that the
hero of this history, in the first plate of the series, is
unmeaning; and in the second, ungraceful. The fact
is admitted; but, for so delineating him, the author
is entitled to our praise rather than our censure.
Rakewell's whole conduct proves he was a fool, and
at that time he had not learned how to perform
an artificial character; he therefore looks as he is,
unmeaning and uninformed. But in the second plate
he is ungraceful&mdash;granted. The ill-educated son of
so avaricious a father could not have been introduced
into very good company; and though, by the different
teachers who surround him, it evidently appears that
he wishes to assume the character of a gentleman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>his internal feelings tell him he has not attained it.
Under that consciousness, he is properly and naturally
represented as ungraceful and embarrassed in his
new situation.</p>

<p>The light, it must be acknowledged, is very ill distributed,
and the figures most inartificially grouped.
To infer from hence, with Mr. Gilpin, that the artist
was at a loss how to group them, is not quite fair:
his others compositions prove that he was not ignorant
of the art, but in many of them he has been
inattentive to it. In this he may have introduced
in his print figures which were not inserted in the
sketch, merely because they were appropriate to his
story. The expression of the actors in his drama
was always his leading object; composition he considered
as secondary, and was little solicitous about
their situation on the stage.</p>

<div class="caption">THE RAKE'S PROGRESS, PLATE III.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This plate exhibits our licentious prodigal engaged
in one of his midnight festivities: forgetful of the
past, and negligent of the future, he riots in the
present. Having poured his libation to Bacchus, he
concludes the evening orgies in a sacrifice at the
Cyprian shrine; and, surrounded by the votaries of
Venus, joins in the unhallowed mysteries of the place.
The companions of his revelry are marked with that
easy, unblushing effrontery which belongs to the
servants of all work in the isle of Paphos;&mdash;for the
maids of honour, they are not sufficiently elevated.</p>

<p>He may be supposed, in the phrase of the day, to
have beat the rounds, overset a constable, and conquered
a watchman, whose staff and lanthorn he has
brought into the room as trophies of his prowess.
In this situation he is robbed of his watch by the
girl whose hand is in his bosom; and, with that
adroitness peculiar to an old practitioner, she conveys
her acquisition to an accomplice, who stands behind
the chair.</p>

<p>Two of the ladies are quarrelling; and one of them
delicately spouts wine in the face of her opponent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
who is preparing to revenge the affront with a knife,
which, in a posture of threatening defiance, she grasps
in her hand. A third, enraged at being neglected,
holds a lighted candle to a map of the globe, determined
to set the world on fire though she perish in
the conflagration! A fourth is undressing. The
fellow bringing in a pewter dish,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> as part of the
apparatus of this elegant and attic entertainment, a
blind harper,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> a trumpeter, and a ragged ballad-singer
roaring out an obscene song, completes this motley
group.</p>

<p>This design may be a very exact representation of
what were then the nocturnal amusements of a
brothel;&mdash;so different are the manners of the year
1805 from those of 1734, that I much question
whether a similar exhibition is now to be seen in any
tavern of the metropolis. That we are less licentious
than our predecessors, I dare not affirm; but we are
certainly more delicate in the pursuit of our pleasures.</p>

<p>The room is furnished with a set of Roman emperors,&mdash;they
are not placed in their proper order;
for in the mad revelry of the evening this family of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>frenzy have decollated all of them except Nero; and
his manners had too great a similarity to their own
to admit of his suffering so degrading an insult: their
reverence for <em>virtue</em> induced them to spare his head.
In the frame of a Cæsar they have placed the portrait
of Pontac, an eminent cook, whose great talents being
turned to heightening sensual rather than mental
enjoyments, he has a much better chance of a votive
offering from this company than would either Vespasian
or Trajan.</p>

<p>The shattered mirror, broken wine-glasses, fractured
chair and cane; the mangled fowl, with a fork stuck
in its breast, thrown into a corner, and indeed every
accompaniment, shows that this has been a night of
riot without enjoyment, mischief without wit, and
waste without gratification.</p>

<p>With respect to the drawing of the figures in this
curious female coterie, Hogarth evidently intended
several of them for beauties; and of vulgar, uneducated,
prostituted beauty, he had a good idea. The
hero of our tale displays all that careless jollity which
copious draughts of maddening wine are calculated
to inspire; he laughs the world away, and bids it
pass. The poor dupe without his periwig, in the
background, forms a good contrast of character: he
is maudlin drunk, and sadly sick. To keep up the
spirit of unity throughout the society, and not leave
the poor African girl entirely neglected, she is making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
signs to her friend the porter, who perceives, and
slightly returns, her love-inspiring glance. This print
is rather crowded,&mdash;the subject demanded it should
be so; some of the figures thrown into shade might
have helped the general effect, but would have injured
the characteristic expression.</p>

<div class="caption">THE RAKE'S PROGRESS, PLATE IV.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The career of dissipation is here stopped. Dressed
in the first style of the <em>ton</em>, and getting out of a sedan
chair, with the hope of shining in the circle, and perhaps
forwarding a former application for a place or a
pension, he is arrested! To intimate that being plundered
is the certain consequence of such an event, and
to show how closely one misfortune treads upon the
heels of another, a boy is at the same moment picking
his pocket.</p>

<p>The unfortunate girl whom he basely deserted is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>now a milliner, and naturally enough attends in the
crowd to mark the fashions of the day. Seeing his
distress, with all the eager tenderness of unabated
love, she flies to his relief. Possessed of a small sum
of money, the hard earnings of unremitted industry,
she generously offers her purse for the liberation of her
worthless favourite. This releases the captive beau,
and displays a strong instance of female affection,
which, being once planted in the bosom, is rarely
eradicated by the coldest neglect or harshest cruelty.</p>

<p>The high-born, haughty Welshman, with an enormous
leek, and a countenance keen and lofty as his
native mountains, establishes the chronology, and
fixes the day to be the first of March; which, being
sacred to the titular saint of Wales, was observed at
court.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The background exhibits a view of St James's
Palace, and White's Chocolate House, then the rendezvous
of the first gamesters in London. At this
fountainhead of dissipation the artist has aimed a
flash of lightning; and to show the contagion of example,
and how much this ruinous vice prevails even
in the lowest ranks of society, he has in one corner of
the print represented an assembly composed of shoe-blacks,
chimney-sweepers, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> who, aping the vices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>of their superiors, are engaged at cards, dice, cups
and balls, and pricking in the belt. To intimate how
eagerly these minor gamblers enter into the spirit of
what they are engaged in, one of them is naked, and
having staked and lost his clothes, is now throwing
for his stock in trade, a basket, brushes, and blacking.
The little smutty smoking politician is reading the
<cite>Farthing Post</cite>; his attention is exquisitely marked;
his whole soul is engaged; and, regardless of the confusion
which reigns around, he contemplates</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"The fate of empires, and the fall of kings."</p>
</div></div>

<p>A chimney-sweeper peeping at the postboy's cards,
and informing his adversary that he has two honours,
by holding up two fingers, is a fine stroke of humour;
as the inscription <em>Black's</em>, being on a post<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> close
to where this congress of the <em>privileged orders</em> are
assembled, is an excellent antithesis when contrasted
to <em>White's</em>, on the opposite side.</p>

<p>The grouping is good, the perspective agreeable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and the expression admirable. The trembling terror
of the beau, agitated to the very soul, is well contrasted
by the hard unfeeling insolence of two bailiffs;
and that, again, opposed by the tender solicitude of
the poor girl. The gunpowder mark of a star on the
side of the naked shoe-black, who is putting his last
stake on the hazard of a die, is another well-pointed
piece of satire on the conduct of those high-born
gamesters, who at the opposite house, with a dignified
disregard for the future fate of themselves or their
families, put their last acre on the same issue. The
boy with a pipe and little pewter measure and glass
by his side, shows that smoking and drinking drams
was not peculiar to adults, but sometimes practised
by young gentlemen before their attainment of what
the law calls years of discretion.</p>

<p class="noindent">To be thus degraded by the rude enforcement of the
law, and relieved from an exigence by one whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
had injured, would have wounded, humbled, I had
almost said reclaimed, any man who had either feeling
or elevation of mind; but, to mark the progression
of vice, we here see this depraved, lost character,
hypocritically violating every natural feeling of the
soul to recruit his exhausted finances, and marrying
an old and withered Sibyl, at the sight of whom
nature must recoil.</p>

<p>The ceremony passes in Marybone Church, which
was then considered at such a distance from London,
as to become the usual resort of those who wished to
be privately married.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> That such was the view of this
prostituted young man, may be fairly inferred from a
glance at the object of his choice. Her charms are
heightened by the affectation of an amorous leer,
which she directs to her youthful husband, in grateful
return for a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'similiar compliment'">similar compliment</ins> which she supposed
paid to herself. This gives her face much meaning,
but meaning of such a sort, that an observer being
asked, "How dreadful must be this creature's hatred?"
would naturally reply, "How hateful must be her
love!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>In his demeanour we discover an attempt to appear
at the altar with becoming decorum: but internal
perturbation darts through assumed tranquillity; for
though he is plighting his troth to the old woman, his
eyes are fixed on the young girl who kneels behind
her.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The parson and clerk seem made for each other:
a sleepy, stupid solemnity marks every muscle of
the divine, and the nasal droning of the lay brother
is most happily expressed. Accompanied by her
child and mother, the unfortunate victim of his
seduction is here again introduced, endeavouring to
enter the church and forbid the banns. The opposition
made by an old pew-opener, with her bunch
of keys, gave the artist a good opportunity for
indulging his taste in the burlesque, and he has not
neglected it.</p>

<p>A dog<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> paying his addresses to a one-eyed quadruped
of his own species, is a happy parody of the
unnatural union going on in the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commandments are broken:<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> a crack runs
near the tenth, which says, "Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbour's wife;" a prohibition in the present case
hardly necessary. The Creed is destroyed by the
damps of the church; and so little attention has
been paid to the poor's box, that&mdash;it is covered with
a cobweb!!! These three high-wrought strokes of
satirical humour were perhaps never equalled by an
exertion of the pencil; excelled they cannot be.</p>

<p>On one of the pew-doors is the following curious
specimen of churchyard poetry and mortuary orthography:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pad2 noindent fs90 smcap">

<p class="p1" />
<p>A glory over the bride's head is whimsical.</p>

<p>The bay and holly, which decorate the pews, give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>a date to the period, and determine this preposterous
union of January with June to have taken place
about the time of Christmas,</p>

<p class="verse">"When Winter linger'd in her icy veins."</p>

<p>Addison would have classed her among the evergreens

<p>It has been observed, that "the church is too small,

use, divides the picture very disagreeably."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> This
cannot be denied: but it appears to be meant as an
accurate representation of the place, and the artist
delineated what he saw.</p>

<p>The grouping is good, and the principal figure has
the air of a gentleman. The light is well distributed,
and the scene most characteristically represented.</p>

<p class="noindent">Though now, from the infatuated folly of his
antiquated wife, in possession of a fortune, he is still
the slave of that baneful vice which, while it enslaves
the mind, poisons the enjoyments, and sweeps away
the possessions of its deluded votaries. Destructive
as the earthquake which convulses nature, it overwhelms
the pride of the forest, and engulfs the
labours of the architect.</p>

<p>Newmarket and the cock-pit were the scenes of his
early amusements; to crown the whole, he is now
exhibited at a gaming-table, where all is lost! His
countenance distorted with agony, and his soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>agitated almost to madness, he imprecates vengeance
upon his own head.</p>

<p class="verse">He beats his brow, with rage and horror fraught;</p>
<p class="verse">His brow half bursts with agony of thought!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>That he should be deprived of all he possessed in
such a society as surround him, is not to be wondered
at. One of the most conspicuous characters appears,
by the pistols in his pocket, to be a highwayman:
from the profound stupor of his countenance, we are
certain he also is a losing gamester; and so absorbed
in reflection, that neither the boy who brings him a
glass of water, nor the watchman's cry of Fire! can
arouse him from his reverie. Another of the party
is marked for one of those well-dressed Continental
adventurers, who, being unable to live in their own
country, annually pour into this, and with no other
requisites than a quick eye, an adroit hand, and an
undaunted forehead, are admitted into what is absurdly
enough called good company.</p>

<p>At the table a person in mourning grasps his hat,
and hides his face in the agony of repentance,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> not
having, as we infer from his weepers, received that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
legacy of which he is now plundered more than a
little month. On the opposite side is another on
whom fortune has severely frowned, biting his nails
in the anguish of his soul. The fifth completes the
climax; he is frantic, and with a drawn sword
endeavours to destroy a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pauvre miserable</i> whom he
supposes to have cheated him, but is prevented by
the interposition of one of those staggering votaries
of Bacchus who are to be found in every company
where there is good wine; and gaming, like the rod
of Moses, so far swallows up every other passion, that
the actors, engrossed by greater objects, willingly
leave their wine to the audience.</p>

<p>In the background are two collusive associates
eagerly dividing the profits of the evening.</p>

<p>A nobleman in the corner is giving his note to an
usurer.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The lean and hungry appearance of this
cent. per cent. worshipper of the golden calf is well
contrasted by the sleek contented vacancy of so well-employed
a legislator of this great empire. Seated
at the table, a portly gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> of whom we see
very little, is coolly sweeping off his winnings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>So engrossed is every one present by his own situation,
that the flames which surround them are disregarded,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>

<p class="noindent">It is pithily and profitably observed by Mr. Hugh
Latimer, or some other venerable writer of his day,
that "the direct path from a gaming-house is unto a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>prisonne, for the menne who doe neeste themselves
in these pestiferous hauntes, being either fooles or
cheates, be punished: if fooles, by their own undoing;
if cheates, by the biting lash of the beadle,
and the durance of their vile bodies."</p>

<p>In the plate before us this remark is verified.
Our improvident spendthrift is now lodged in that
dreary receptacle of human misery&mdash;a prison. His
countenance exhibits a picture of despair; the forlorn
state of his mind is displayed in every limb, and
his exhausted finances by the turnkey's demand of
prison fees not being answered, and the boy refusing
to leave a tankard of porter unless he is paid for it.</p>

<p>We learn by a letter upon the table, that a play
which he sent for the manager's inspection "will not
doe;"<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and we see by the enraged countenance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
his wife, that she is violently reproaching him for
having deceived and ruined her. To crown this catalogue
of human tortures, the poor girl whom he deserted
is come with her child,&mdash;perhaps to comfort
him, to alleviate his sorrows, to soothe his sufferings:
but the agonizing view is too much for her agitated
frame; shocked at the prospect of that misery which
she cannot remove, every object swims before her
eyes, a film covers the sight, the blood forsakes
her cheeks, her lips assume a pallid hue, and she
sinks to the floor of the prison in temporary death.
What a heart-rending prospect for him by whom
this is occasioned! Should he in the anguish of
his soul inquire, "Who is it that hath caused this?"
that inward monitor, which to him must be a perpetual
torment, would reply in the words that Nathan
said unto David, "Thou art the man!" Such an
accumulation of woe must shake reason from her
throne. The thin partitions which divide judgment
from distraction are thrown down, the fine fibres of
the brain are overstrained, and in the place of godlike
apprehension,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Chaos and anarchy assume the sway."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">That balm of a wounded mind,&mdash;the recollection of

heaved from the heart, pierce the air! he is chained!
rages! gnashes his teeth, and tears his quivering

<p class="verseq">"A fiend, in evil moments ever nigh,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent">But let us for a moment return to the present scene.
The wretched, squalid inmate who is assisting the
fainting female, bears every mark of being naturalized
to the place: out of his pocket hangs a scroll,
on which is inscribed, "A scheme to pay the national
debt, by J. L., now a prisoner in the Fleet." So attentive
was this poor gentleman to the debts of the
nation, that he totally forgot his own. The cries of
the child, and the good-natured attentions of the two
women, heighten the interest, and realize the scene.
Over the group are a large pair of wings, with which
some emulator of Dedalus intended to escape from
his confinement; but finding them inadequate to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
execution of his project, has placed them upon the
tester of his bed. They would not exalt him to the
regions of air, but they o'er-canopy him on earth. A
chemist in the background, happy in his views, watching
the moment of projection, is not to be disturbed
from his dream by anything less than the fall of the
roof or the bursting of his retort; and if his dream
affords him felicity, why should he be awakened?
The bed and gridiron, those poor remnants of our
miserable spendthrift's wrecked property, are brought
here as necessary in his degraded situation; on one
he must try to repose his wearied frame, on the other
he is to dress his scanty meal.</p>

<p>The grated gate, secured with tenfold bars of iron,
reminds us of Milton's</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Infernal doors, that on their hinges grate</p>
<p class="verse">Harsh thunder!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The principal figure is wonderfully delineated.
Every muscle is marked, every nerve is unstrung;
we see into his very soul. The poor prisoner who is
assisting the fainting woman is ill drawn; the group
of which she is the principal figure is unskilfully
contrived: it forms a round heavy mass. The opposite
group, though better, is not pleasing.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Last scene of all,&mdash;which ends this strange eventful
history!"</p>

<p>But in this scene, dreary and horrid as are its
accompaniments, he is attended by the faithful and
kind-hearted female whom he so basely betrayed.
In the first plate we see him refuse her his promised
hand. In the fourth she releases him from the harpy
fangs of a bailiff; she is present at his marriage. In
the hope of relieving his distress, she follows him to a
prison. Wishing to soothe his misery and alleviate
his woe, she here attends him in a madhouse!
What a return for deceit and desertion!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Gilpin, in his elucidation of these
eight prints, asserts that "this thought is rather
unnatural, and the moral certainly culpable."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> With
the utmost deference for his critical abilities, I must
entertain a different opinion. We have had many
similar examples of female attachment. If it be
culpable to forgive those which have despitefully
used us, to free those which are in bonds, to visit
those which are in prison, and to comfort those
which are in affliction, what meaning have the divine
precepts of our holy religion?</p>

<p>The female mind is naturally credulous, affectionate,
and&mdash;in its attachments&mdash;ardent. If, in her
peculiar situation, her assiduities must be deemed in
any degree culpable, let us remember that this is
but a frail vessel of refined clay. When the awful
record of her errors is unrolled, may that sigh which
was breathed for the misery of a fellow-mortal waft
away the scroll, and the tears which flowed for the
calamities of others float the memorial down the
stream of oblivion!</p>

<p>On the errors of women, let us look with the allowance
and humanity of men. Enchanting woman!
thou balm of life! soother of sorrow! solace of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>soul! how dost thou lessen the load of human misery,
and lead the wretched into the valley of delight!
Without thee, how heavily would man drag through
a dreary world; but if the white hand of a fascinating
female be twined round his arm, how joyous, how
lightly doth he trip along the path!</p>

<p>That warm and tender friend, who in the most trying
situations retains her enthusiastic fondness, and
in every change of fortune preserves unabated love,
ought to be embraced as the first bension of heaven,
the completion of earthly happiness! Let man but
draw such a prize in the lottery of life, and glide down
the stream of existence with such a partner, and neither
the cold averted eye of a summer friend, nor the frowns
of an adverse fortune, should ever produce a pang or
excite a murmur. But enough,&mdash;let not the chaste
feelings of blushing innocence be wounded by this
rhapsody, or for a moment suppose that the episode,
or effusion, or e'en whatever she pleases, is intended
as a vindication of female folly; in good truth it is
not. The writer would not wish it delivered to the
cold-fingered portress of Diana's temple, but it may
be laid upon that altar which is sacred to Friendship,
to Hymen, to Love.&mdash;There we will leave it, and
return to the plate before us.</p>

<p>A gentleman<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> from whom I have once or twice reluctantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
presumed to differ, says that "the drawing
of the principal figure is a more accurate piece of
anatomy than we commonly find in the works of this
master." The observation is perfectly just, but the
inaccuracies of Mr. Hogarth did not arise from inability,
but from inattention. He says further, that
"the expression of the principal figure is rather unmeaning."
The late and ever to be lamented Mr.
Mortimer, whose wonderful abilities as an artist were
only equalled by his amiable and kind-hearted virtues
as a man,&mdash;the late Mr. Mortimer, of whom I can
never think without a sigh of regard and regret,
thought very differently. He was once requested to
delineate several of the passions, as they are personified
by Mr. Gray. One of the subjects proposed
was,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Moody madness, laughing wild, amid severest woe."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The instant this line was read to him, he opened a
portfolio, took out the eighth plate of the "Rake's
Progress," and pointing to the principal figure, exclaimed,
"Sir, if I had never seen this print, I should
say it was not possible to paint these contending
passions in the same countenance. Having seen this,
which exactly displays Mr. Gray's idea, I dare not
attempt it. I could only make a correct copy; for
the alteration of a single line would be a departure
from the character."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The reclining figure, with a cross leaning near him,
is in a high degree terrific.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

</div></div>

<p>In the cell are the portraits of three saints, whose
systems were built on the necessity of propagating the
religion of mercy by the sword and the wheel.</p>

<p>Near him are two astronomers, one with a paper
rolled up to imitate a telescope, gazing at the roof, in
the idea that it is</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"The spacious canopy of heaven, fretted with golden fires."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The other, delineating the firing off a bomb and a
ship moored at a distance, is an immediate ridicule of
Whiston's project for the discovery of the longitude,&mdash;an
object which at this time engaged the attention
of the philosophical world, and in the fruitless search
after which many a feeble head hath become mad,
north&mdash;north-west!</p>

<p>The opposite group form a whimsical trio. A mad
musician, a counterfeit presentment of St. Peter, and
a poor gentleman, with his hands clasped together,
that appears by the inscription of "Charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>

<p class="verse">"Grate harshly on the nerve auricular,"</p>

<p class="noindent">nor the roar of the pope, who is furiously denouncing

<p>A crazy tailor and a mimic monarch complete this
congregation of calamity.</p>

<p>Two women, impelled by a most unaccountable
curiosity, are walking in the background. Devoid
of that delicacy which gives beauty new attractions,
they forget that an eagerness to witness woe which
they cannot alleviate, gives strong indication of an
hardened and unfeeling heart.</p>

<p>The halfpenny stuck against a wall, and dated
1763, was inserted by Mr. Hogarth the year before
his death, and is designed to intimate that Britannia
was then mad. This is one of the few instances
wherein he has called in the aid of allegory, but his
allegory was always seasoned with wit.</p>

<p>Of the expression I have already spoken. The
disposition of the figures is good. That group in
which the usurper of St. Peter's chair is the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
object, is well contrived. There is great simplicity
and breadth in the background, and the light and
perspective are judicious.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Protract not, curious ears, the mournful tale;</p>
<p class="verse">But o'er the hapless group low drop Compassion's veil."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The eight prints of the "Rake's Progress," with
"Southwark Fair," were advertised in the <cite>London
Daily Post</cite> to be delivered June 25th, 1735, with an
apology for the publication being deferred, which Mr.
Hogarth states to have been occasioned by his waiting
until the royal assent was given to an Act intended
to secure all new invented prints from being
copied, etc.</p>

<p>This series are in every respect superior to those
which preceded them, but were not honoured with an
equal attention by the public.</p>

<p>From what did this arise? Were the town more
interested in the story of an harlot than in the adventures
of a rake, or had this new mode of engraving
history lost its novelty?</p>

<p>On this occasion was published an octavo pamphlet,
entitled, "<cite>The Rake's Progress, or the Humours of
Drury Lane</cite>, a Poem in eight Cantos, in Hudibrastic
verse; being the Rambles of a modern Oxonian:
which is a complete Key to the eight Prints lately
published by the celebrated Mr. Hogarth. Printed
for John Chetwood, and sold at Inigo Jones' Head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
against Exeter Change, Strand, 1735." This is a most
contemptible and indecent performance. In some of
the copies are inserted eight prints; but they are
only the designs of Hogarth mutilated, and perhaps
were originally engraved for the decoration of some
other work.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the artist once intended
to have introduced the ceremony of a marriage
contract, instead of the levee, as an unfinished painting
of the scene is still preserved. In this sketch he
appears to have thought of taking the same ground
with Mr. Pope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"What brought Sir Visto's ill-got wealth to waste?</p>
<p class="verse">Some demon whisper'd, 'Visto, have a taste.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">For our Rake is there turned connoisseur; and
among a number of articles which prove him a man
of <em>virtu</em>, is a canvas containing the representation of
a human foot.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1745 the eight pictures were sold by
auction, at Mr. Hogarth's in Leicester Fields, and produced
twenty-two guineas each; total, one hundred
and eighty-four pounds, sixteen shillings. They are
now, I believe, in the possession of Mr. Beckford of
Fonthill, in Wiltshire.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">At a time when martial hardihood was the
only accomplishment likely to confer distinction,
when war was thought to be the
most honourable pursuit, and agriculture deemed the
only necessary employment, there was little social
intercourse, and so few retail dealers, that men had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>very easy means of procuring those articles which they
occasionally wanted. To remove this inconvenience,
it was found necessary to establish some general mart,
where they might be supplied. Fairs were therefore
instituted, as a proper medium between the buyer and
seller, and were at first considered as merely places of
trade.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> They were generally held on saints' days.
Some of them continued open many weeks, and had
peculiar privileges to encourage the attendance of
those who had goods upon sale. The pedlar travelled
from city to city, or from town to town, with his moveable
warehouse, and furnished his customers with
what served them until his periodical return.</p>

<p>As men grew more polished their wants increased,
their intercourse became more general, and the importance
of commerce was better understood. The
merchant deposited his goods in a warehouse, and the
trader opened a shop. Fairs, deserted by men of
business, gradually changed their nature, and, instead
of being crowded by the active and the industrious,
were the haunts of the idle and the dissolute.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Such
were they at the time of this delineation, which was
made about the year 1733, and may be considered as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>a true picture of the holiday amusements of that
period. At the head of these we must place what
were than called stage-plays,&mdash;a most favourite diversion
of your Englishman ever since the time</p>

<p>In these humble representations some of our greatest
actors made their first appearance; and not a few
of them, even after they had attained high eminence,
ranted, strutted, and bellowed through all the days
the fairs were kept open, to their own emolument,
and the heartfelt pleasure of the Wapping beaux
and the black-eyed beauties of Saltpetre Bank.</p>

Bajazet</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;and it is performed to the life; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
unsure scaffolding, not being built to bear the terror-working
stamps of the furious Turk, tumbles to the
ground. The tyrant's turban is shaken from his head,
the truncheon is dropped from his hand, and with the
moralizing Tamerlane he joins the general crash, and
threatens destruction to the china jars and bowls
which are beneath. Not only the heroes and heroine
of the drama, but both band and musical instruments
are involved in the ruin. The band, it is true, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>sists
of&mdash;a solitary fiddler; and the instruments are&mdash;a
violin and a salt-box. The monkey and the merry-andrew
seem the only two animals likely to evade
injury in this universal wreck. Corporeal dexterity
at such a time is more useful than mental acquirements.</p>

<p>The Amazonian, with a hat, feather, and drum, is a
beauty of Mr. Hogarth's school, belongs to a company
of comedians, and is beating up for an audience. The
gaping astonishment of two rustics who are looking
at her is inimitably described. One of them, awe-struck
by her figure, has pulled off his hat in reverence
of her charms; the other "wonders with a foolish
face of praise."</p>

<p>A buskined hero, arrayed perhaps for an Alexander,
has his career of glory stopped by a sheriff's
officer, who pays no respect</p>

<p>A younger branch of the family of the Simples,

defiance to all who dare appear as his competitors.</p>

<p>A juggler, in a senatorial wig, displays magic wonders
with the cups and balls; and above him is a
fellow with a pair of artificial legs extended on a

to a tumbler, who kneels upon the other. A
hat displayed on the end of a pole is the prize of the
best wrestler on the green; and a holland chemise
will reward the <em>fair racer</em> swiftest of foot.</p>

<p>A quack doctor, in laced hat, long periwig, and
embroidered coat, mounted upon a stage and attended

part of the play. By a sun upon the breast of the
figure in a mitre, we know him to be the high-priest
of Apollo, the venerable Chryses. While one arm of

stretched out in moving supplication, entreating the
hearers to</p>

<p class="noindent">Chryseïs, however, is perfectly satisfied with her situation.
Seated in all the pride of conscious beauty
close to the haughty Atrides, and glorying in his

figures. His Madame Catharina does not excite the
attention she merits: the woman with a dice-box has
superior attractions; and a country fellow, in a coat
which seems to have been the Sunday habiliment of
his forefathers for many generations, is trying his fortune,
though earnestly dissuaded by his more prudent
son from putting his pence in so perilous a situation.
The woman, with that energetic eloquence which
marks the orators of Billingsgate, rates the boy for
daring to doubt her honesty. On the other side, a
Savoyard music-grinder, with her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galante</i> show, is
attended by a dwarf drummer, and collecting pence
from the little people who prefer a wonderful and
surprising prospect of every court in Europe to a
pennyworth of gingerbread. In the distance, a set of
figures have been engaged at quarter-staff, then a
favourite amusement; and the conqueror, waving his

honour of his prowess.</p>

<p>A show-cloth over the <cite>Fall of Bajazet</cite> is almost a
direct copy from a very coarse etching made by John
Laguerre, son of Louis Laguerre, whom Pope has immortalized
for his sprawling saints. On the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
part of the print is inscribed, "The Stage Mutiny."
It alludes to some disputes between the managers of
Drury Lane and such of the actors as were spirited
up to rebellion by Theophilus Cibber, and seceded to
the Haymarket in 1733. As this made much noise
in its day, it may not be unentertaining to narrate
some of the circumstances which occasioned it.</p>

<p>The patent for Drury Lane being renewed, Mr.
Booth, who found his health decline, began to think
it was time to dispose of his share and interest in the
theatre. The purchaser was John Highmore, Esq.,
a gentleman who had unhappily contracted an attachment
to the stage, from having one night performed
the part of Lothario for a wager.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> He gave Booth
£2500 for half his share in the property, and his
whole right in the management. Mr. Wilkes had
previously appointed Ellis his deputy; and Colley
Cibber, extremely displeased that two strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
should be thus empowered to interfere, authorized his
son to act for him in everything that concerned his
share in the management. The first season ended
with some profit to the new patentees; but Mr.
Highmore being disgusted by the impertinence of
young Cibber, determined to exonerate himself from
his interference, and, for the sum of three thousand
guineas, purchased the elder Cibber's right in the
theatre. Two years had hardly passed before the
principal actors, encouraged by Theophilus Cibber,
determined to revolt from the patentee; and as the
little theatre in the Haymarket was then unoccupied,
agreed to rent it from the proprietor, and opened
their campaign with the comedy of <cite>Love for Love</cite>, at
which they were attended by an elegant and crowded
audience. The patentees, though weakened by this
desertion, began to act at the usual time. To supply
the place of those who had left their service, they had
recourse to such actors as could be procured from the
itinerant companies. With all the help they could
obtain, their performances were inferior to those exhibited
at the Haymarket, and losses came so heavy
upon Mr. Highmore, that he was under the necessity
of giving up the contest, and sold the whole property
to Mr. Charles Fleetwood for about half the sum he
had originally paid for it.'</p>

<p>Upon this circumstance is built the print from
which the show-cloth was copied; it probably an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>nounces
the performance of a farce entitled "<cite>The
Stage Mutineers</cite>, a tragi-comic farcical ballad opera,
acted at Covent Garden in 1733;" which is a burlesque
on the whole contest. Theophilus Cibber,
who was the leader of the malcontents, is in this
farce characterized by the name of Ancient Pistol,
all his speeches being in that high-flown mock-heroic
style with which Shakspeare has marked that boasting
coward. The scene is supposed to be in the
playhouse, and the time, during a rehearsal.</p>

<p>In 1740, a pamphlet was published for J. Mechell, at
the King's Arms, Fleet Street, entitled, "<cite>An Apology
for the Life of T&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;</cite>, Comedian; being a proper
sequel to the Apology for the Life of Mr. Colley
Cibber; with an historical view of the stage to the
present year. Supposed to be written by himself, in
the style and manner of the poet-laureate:" but in
reality the work of Harry Fielding. The following
passage, relative to this subject, occurs in page 16,
etc:&mdash;"In that year, when the stage fell into great
commotions, and the Drury Lane company, asserting
the glorious cause of liberty and property, made a
stand against the oppressions of the patentees;&mdash;in
that memorable year, when the theatric dominions
fell in labour of a revolution, under the conduct of
myself; that revolt gave occasion to several pieces of
wit and satirical flirts at the conductor of the enterprise.
I was attacked, as my father had been before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
me, in the public papers and journals; and the
burlesque character of Pistol was attributed to me as
a real one. Out came a print of Jack Laguerre's,
representing, in most vile designing, this expedition
of ours, under the name of 'The Stage Mutiny;' in
which, gentle reader, your humble servant, in the
Pistol character, was the principal figure. This I
laughed at, knowing it only a proper embellishment
for one of those necessary structures to which persons
out of necessity repair." Again, p. 88: "At the
fair of Bartholomew we gained some recruits; but,
besides those advantages over the enemy, I myself
went there in person, and publicly exposed myself.
This was done to fling defiance in the patentees' teeth;
for, on the booth where I exhibited, I hung out 'The
Stage Mutiny,' with Pistol at the head of his troop;
our standard bearing the motto, 'We eat.'" Whether
this account which Cibber is made to give of his
own conduct is entirely jocular, or contains a mixture
of truth and falsehood, cannot now be ascertained.
Hogarth may have transferred a circumstance from
Bartholomew to Southwark Fair; or Fielding, by
design, may have misrepresented it, alluding at the
same time to Hogarth's print.</p>

<p>To return to the show-cloth. The figure seated in
the corner, with his head bound with laurel, is intended
to represented old Cibber, then poet-laureate. With
a bag of money upon his knee, he rejoices in the sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
he has realized, and laughs at those who are enduring
the storm. Under his feet is inscribed "Quiet and
snug." The tall, thin figure, stooping, is meant for
Mr. Highmore. He holds in his hand a scroll, on
which is written, "It cost 6000 pounds." He is
again characterized in the figure of a monkey astride
the sign-iron of the Rose Tavern, with a label, on
which is written, "I am a gentleman."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>&mdash;The man in
his shirt, with a paint-pot and brushes at his feet, who
takes up the cudgels for the new patentees, is John
Ellis the painter. He was the pupil of Sir James
Thornhill, deputy-manager for Mr. Wilkes, and principal
scene painter to the theatre. By the favour of
the Duke of Montagu and Sir Robert Walpole, he
was appointed to be great master of the wardrobe,
and keeper of the lions in the Tower. He was
much happier in attending a pugilistic exhibition at
Broughton's academy than in the exercise of his
profession. His figure appears muscular, but hardly
leads one to suppose, what is yet certainly a fact,
that Rysbrack&mdash;when he produced what Mr. Walpole
very emphatically calls that exquisite summary of
his skill, knowledge, and judgment, the "Hercules,"
now in Mr. Hoare's temple at Stourhead&mdash;modelled
the legs of the god from those of Ellis.&mdash;The figure
in the background, with a tremendous plume of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
feathers, and a flowing periwig, grasping his truncheon
in a style of defiance, may be Mills, in the character
of Bajazet. On the flag which is borne between Mr.
Highmore and Ellis, is inscribed, "We'll starve them
out." On that borne in the rear of the seceders, on
the opposite side, is written, "We eat." The figure
near it is probably intended to represent Johnson, in
Sir Hugh Evans; as that with a truncheon in his
hand, who stands next him, may be intended for
Bardolph; but who the performer was, I am not well
enough versed in dramatic history to determine: it
would probably be known at that time, by the ends
of two cudgels, which rise in parallel lines immediately
behind his head, and may perhaps intimate
that this gentleman, as well as Theophilus Cibber,
was under some obligations to his wife for giving him
a title he was not born with.&mdash;The Sir John Falstaff
was certainly intended for Harper,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> who was eminent
in that character; as Pistol, with the inscription,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
"Pistol's alive," was indisputably meant for the
younger Cibber. The masculine gentlewoman, waving
a flag on which is inscribed "Liberty and Property,"
is, I think, clearly intended as a portraiture
of the notorious Mistress Doll Tearsheet; but who
was the actress that personated this fair friend of
the fat knight, I really do not know.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The show-cloth underneath, with the tall figure
and two spectators, is a representation of Maximilian,
a giant from Upper Saxony. That with the wooden
horse is explained by the inscription above it, "The
Siege of Troy is here." Mr. Victor, in an eulogium
upon Boheme the actor, says that "his first appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
was at a booth in Southwark Fair, which in those
days lasted two weeks, and was much frequented by
persons of all ranks and both sexes. He acted the
part of Menelaus, in the best droll I ever saw, called
<cite>The Siege of Troy</cite>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The Adam and Eve upon another show-cloth
may probably allude to the representation of somewhat
compiled from an old mystery called <cite>The
Creation</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The old puppet-show joke of Punch wheeling his
wife into the jaws of destruction, which is underneath,
is well known. By the paper lantern, dwarf drummer,
and little figure at a temporary door, it appears that
the royal waxwork and whole Court of France are at
the Royal Oak.</p>

<p>It is a little remarkable, that in this almost endless
variety of holiday amusements there should be no
exhibition of wild beasts<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> or wonderful quadrupeds.
A roaring lion, raging tiger, and fierce cat a-mountain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>would have had a large audience; and a learned pig
or an overgrown Lincolnshire ox might have made
the proprietors' fortunes at that time, as they have
done at this.</p>

<p>The amusements of the fair at this period continued
a fortnight,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and were unquestionably attended with
much loss of time, and productive of some habits of
dissipation among the lower ranks of people who attended
them. A visit to a family in the vicinity must
have been a delightful entertainment, and the pleasure
much heightened if the lady of the mansion happened
to be fond of dumb creatures. A whistle, drum, and
trumpet, in the possession of three little masters, with
a barking lap-dog, screaming parrot, and canary bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in full song, must form a concert of such heavenly
harmony, as</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Would bring an angel down!"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">For those who delight in pointing out examples of
Hogarth's bad spelling, this print affords a fine field.
The name of Cibber is spelt with only one <em>b</em>. In the
<cite>Fall of Bajazet</cite>, the <em>z</em> appears to have been originally
an <em>s</em>. "We'l starve them out." The <em>e</em> final
in waxworke, these syllable dissectors may perhaps
deign to acknowledge was then customary.</p>

<p>In my enumeration of some of the actors who appear
on the show-cloth, etc., I may sometimes be
wrong: let it be received as conjecture founded on
the best information I could obtain; and let it be remembered,
that to procure positive information of
circumstances which happened near fifty years ago
is not easy. The memoranda to be found in magazines,
and other perishable prints of the day, are not
always to be depended upon. Even now these authentic
documents sometimes lead those who implicitly
believe them into error.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p class="drop-capx">Notwithstanding this inscription,
which was engraved on the plate some
time after its publication, it is very certain
that most of these figures were intended for individual
portraits; but Mr. Hogarth, not wishing to be considered
as a personal satirist, and fearful of making
enemies among his contemporaries, would never
acknowledge who were the characters. Some of them
the world might perhaps mistake; for though the
author was faithful in delineating whatever he intended
to portray, complete intoxication so far caricatures
the countenance, that, according to the old though
trite proverb, "the man is not himself." His portrait,
though given with the utmost fidelity, will scarcely
be known by his most intimate friends, unless they
have previously seen him in this degrading disguise.
Hence it becomes difficult to identify men whom the
painter did not choose to point out at the time; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>

As I have been told that both these worthies were
distinguished by that clerical rubicundity of face with

<p>The roaring Bacchanalian who stands next him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
waving his glass in the air, has pulled off his wig, and
in the zeal of his friendship crowns the divine's head.
He is evidently drinking destruction to fanatics and
success to Mother Church, or a mitre to the jolly
parson whom he addresses.</p>

<p>The lawyer who sits near him is a portrait of one
Kettleby, a vociferous bar-orator, who, though an utter
barrister, chose to distinguish himself by wearing an
enormous full-bottom wig, in which he is here represented.
He was further remarkable for a diabolical
squint and a Satanic smile. In the <cite>Causidicade</cite> are
a number of lines dedicated to the honour of this
amiable person. They begin with&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Up Kettleby starts with a horrible stare."</p>
</div></div>

<p>A poor maudlin miserable who is addressing him,
when sober, must be a fool; but, in this state, it
would puzzle Lavater to assign him a proper class.
He seems endeavouring to demonstrate to the lawyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
that in a poi&mdash;poi&mdash;point of law he has been most
cruelly cheated, and lost a cau&mdash;cau&mdash;cause that he
ought to have got,&mdash;and all this was owing to his
attorney being an infernal villain. This may very
probably be true; for the poor man's tears show that,
like the person relieved by the good Samaritan, he has
been among thieves. The barrister grins horribly at
his misfortunes, and tells him he is properly punished
for not employing a gentleman.</p>

<p>Next to him sits a gentleman in a black periwig.
He politely turns his back to the company, that he
may have the pleasure of smoking a <em>sociable</em> pipe.</p>

<p>The justice, "in fair round belly, with good capon
lin'd,"&mdash;the justice, having hung up his hat, wig, and
cloak, puts on his nightcap, and with a goblet of superior
capacity before him, sits in solemn cogitation.
Meditating severe punishments on the dissolute
peasant who tipples ale or viler liquors, he resolves
for the future to act with magisterial harshness, that
he may convince his neighbours of his zeal for the
law, and detestation of drunkenness. His left elbow
supported by the table and his right by a chair, with
a pipe in one hand and a stopper in the other, he
puffs out the bland vapour with the dignity of an
alderman, and fancies himself as great as Jupiter
seated upon the summit of Mount Olympus, enveloped
by the thick cloud which his own breath has
created.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>With folded arms and open mouth another leans
back in his chair.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> His wig is dropped from his
head, and he is asleep: but though speechless, he is
sonorous; for you clearly perceive that where nasal
sounds are the music, he is qualified to be leader of
the band.</p>

<p>The fallen hero, who with his chair and goblet has
tumbled to the floor, by the cockade in his hat we
suppose to be an officer. His forehead is marked,
perhaps with honourable scars. To wash his wounds
and cool his head, the staggering apothecary bathes it
with brandy.</p>

<p>A gentleman in the corner, who, from having the
<cite>Craftsman</cite> and <cite>London Evening</cite> in his pocket, we
determine to be a politician, very unluckily mistakes
his ruffle for the bowl of his pipe, and sets fire
to it.</p>

<p>The person in a bag-wig and solitaire, with his
hand upon his head,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> would not now pass for a fine
gentleman, but in the year 1735 was a complete beau.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>Unaccustomed to such joyous company, he appears
to have drank rather more than agrees with him.</p>

<p>The company consists of eleven,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and on the
chimney-piece, floor, and table, are three-and-twenty
empty flasks. These, added to a bottle which the
apothecary holds in his hand, prove that this select
society have not lost a moment. The overflowing
bowl, full goblets, and charged glasses, prove that
they think "'tis too early to part," though the dial
points to four in the morning!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"What have we with day to do?</p>
<p class="verse">Sons of Care, Sons of Care, 'twas made for you."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The clock, like the company, is irregular; for the
minute finger and hour hand do not agree. Over
the chimney-piece is a picture, of which we can discover
enough to guess that it has once been a landscape;
but, like the understandings of the gentlemen
present, is so obscured by smoke and vapour as to
appear a mere chaos, without one clear and distinct
form. The fumes of punch, the smoke of pipes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
effluvia of candles sunk into the sockets, must render
the air delightfully balmy, and produce ambrosial
fragrance.</p>

<p>The different degrees of drunkenness are well discriminated,
and its effects admirably described. The
poor simpleton who is weeping out his woes to honest
lawyer Kettleby, it makes mawkish; the beau it
makes sick; and the politician it stupifies. One is
excited to roaring, and another lulled to sleep. It
half closes the eyes of justice, renders the footing of
physic unsure, and lays prostrate the glory of his
country and the pride of war.</p>

<p>On the 22d of March 1742, for the benefit of Mr.
Hippisley, was acted at Covent Garden Theatre a
new scene, called <cite>A Modern Midnight Conversation</cite>,
taken from Hogarth's print, in which was introduced
Hippisley's Drunken Man, with a comic tale of what
really passed between him and his old aunt, at her
house on Mendip Hills, in Somersetshire.</p>

<p>Having described the individuals of which this print
is composed, let us for a moment reflect upon the vice
it is intended to satirize; and considered in a moral
point of view, it may have as good an effect as the
sight of an intoxicated slave had upon the young
men of Sparta. This people sometimes made a slave
drunk, that their sons, disgusted by the sight, might
avoid the practice.</p>

<p>In a book published about a century and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
ago, I remember to have read a tale, which recounteth
that, "Once uponne a tyme, the Divelle was permitted
to tempte a yonge manne. Sathanne had noe
sooner power gyven hym, than hee didde appeere in
the guyze of a grave bencher of Graie's Inne, and
didde tell himme that hee was impoweryd to compelle
hys doing one of these three thynges: eyther
he shoulde morthere his fathere, lie wythe his
mothere, or gette dronke. The young manne," saith
my author, "shockyd atte the two first proposycyons,
didde ymbrace the laste. He gotte verie dronke, and
in thatte state, havying neyther the use of reasonne
nor the dredde of sinne, hee was guyltie offe bothe
the unaturalle deedes hee hadde before soe shudderydde
atte, and for hys naughtinesse and wyckednesse
hee was hangydde."</p>

<p>I have been told that the original picture was some
years since found at an inn in Gloucestershire, and
is now in the possession of J. Calverley, Esq., of Leeds,
in Yorkshire.</p>

<h3>THE SLEEPING CONGREGATION.</h3>

<p class="drop-capx">The shepherd is not much more awake than
his sleeping flock, whose appearance convinces
us that, though there is no organ,
there is much melody. The nasal music of the congregation,
joined to the languid monotony of the
preacher,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> which sounds like the drowsy hum of a
drone bee, must form such a concert as neither Tubal
Cain nor Sir John Hawkins ever dreamed of. The
text is perfectly applicable to the audience, "Come
unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and
I will give you rest." His parishioners have not
troubled themselves much about the Greek version;
good, easy men, they take these words in their literal
sense, and, after the toil of six days, find the church
a comfortable and convenient dormitory. By the
preacher's aspect and attitude, we are convinced that
he would lull to soft repose the most lively assembly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>that ever congregated in the capital. How, then,
must his manner operate here? As an opiate more
powerful than poppies. It is as composing as are the
very descriptive lines that conclude the second book
of Pope's <cite>Dunciad</cite>; which are so perfectly an echo to
the sense, that they ought to be inscribed on the front
of the first temple which is dedicated to Somnus. He</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse12">"In one lazy tone,</p>
<p class="verse">Through the long, heavy, painful page, drawls on.</p>
<p class="verse">Soft creeping words on words the sense compose;</p>
<p class="verse">At every line they stretch, they yawn, they doze.</p>
<p class="verse">As to soft gales top-heavy pines bow low</p>
<p class="verse">Their heads, and lift them as they cease to blow,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus oft they rear, and oft the head decline,</p>
<p class="verse">As breathe or pause by fits the airs divine:</p>
<p class="verse">And now to this side, now to that they nod," etc.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The clerk,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> infinitely more important than the
divine, is kept awake by contemplating the charms of
a voluptuously blooming damsel, who, in studying
the Service of Matrimony, has sighed her soul to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
rest. The eyes of this pronouncer of Amen are
visibly directed to her.</p>

<p>In the pew opposite are five swains of the village;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Each mouth distended, and each head reclin'd,</p>
<p class="verse">They soundly sleep."</p>
</div></div>

<p>To render this rural scene more pastoral, they are
accompanied by two women who have once been
shepherdesses, and perhaps celebrated by some neighbouring
Theocritus as the Chloe and Daphne of their
day. Being now in the wane of their charms, poetical
justice will not allow us to give them any other
appellation than old women. They are awake.
Whether the artist intended by this to show that
they are actuated by the spirit of contradiction, for
the preacher entreats them to go to rest, or meant it
as a compliment to the softer sex, as being more
attentive than men, I cannot tell; let those who have
studied their characters more than I have, determine
as seemeth best in their eyes.</p>

<p>In the gallery are two men joining in chorus with
the band below. One of them has the decency to
hide his face; but the other is evidently in <em>full
song</em>.</p>

<p>The heavy architecture and grotesque decorations
lead us to conjecture that this now venerable edifice
was once the cottage of Baucis and Philemon, so
exquisitely described by Swift:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"<em>Grown to a church by just degrees</em>&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">&mdash;&mdash; The ballads pasted on the wall,</p>
<p class="verse">Of <em>Joan of France</em>, and <em>English Moll</em>,</p>
<p class="verse"><em>Fair Rosamond</em>, and <em>Robin Hood</em>,</p>
<p class="verse"><em>The little Children in the Wood</em>,</p>

<p class="verse">And, high in order plac'd, describe</p>
<p class="verse">The heraldry of every tribe."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The "Children in the Wood" are now exalted
above the Gothic windows. One of them we see
transformed to an angel; which, to prove its being of
a more exalted species, and no longer a mere mortal,
has four thighs.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The pretty Robin Redbreasts, which</p>
<p class="verse">Did cover them with leaves,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">have undergone a transmigration much to their
advantage. It has somewhat sullied their plumage,
but they have assumed a more important appearance,
and the loss of beauty is compensated by an abundant
increase in bulk and dignity. Exalted to the
upper part of a fluted pillar, and seated in heraldic
state, they seem to mortal eyes the emblems of
wisdom, the symbols of Minerva.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>A lion and companion unicorn, concealed by the
pillar, was originally an headpiece to that excellent
old ballad, beginning with</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The fierce lyon of faire Englonde</p>
<p class="verse">Didde swallowe the lillie of France."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">With jaws extended wide enough to swallow a bed of
lilies, he is one of the supporters to the king's arms.</p>

<p>The pews carry evident marks of having been once
a Gothic bedstead. The cumbrous load of oak with
which it was canopied, still supported by large square
posts, is become a gallery. The lower part retains
much of its original form, and answers its original
purpose; but why should I attempt to describe that
which is already described by the Dean?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"A bedstead of the antique mode,</p>
<p class="verse">Compact of timber many a load;</p>
<p class="verse">Such as our ancestors did use,</p>
<p class="verse">Is metamorphos'd into pews,</p>
<p class="verse">Which still their ancient nature keep,</p>
<p class="verse">Of lodging folks dispos'd to sleep."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The pulpit in which our dozing divine is groaning
out the gospel, was once a groaning-chair for the
good wife of the cottage. The cushion on which she
sat for many a winter's eve is now ornamented with
tassels. The arm still retains its original form, though
somewhat more upright than when it served for a
rest to the old dame's elbow. Swift describes the
exact manner of the metamorphosis:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The groaning-chair began to crawl,</p>
<p class="verse">Like an huge snail against the wall;</p>
<p class="verse">There stuck aloft, in public view,</p>
<p class="verse">And with small change a pulpit grew."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The crutches, which erst supported Dame Baucis,
now prop the clerk's reading-desk.</p>

<p>The triangle, environed by a glory, was placed in
the church by old Philemon. In his youth he had
been a very good carpenter, and, when become a
divine, retained so much of his original disposition
as to suppose he could explain an awful mystery by
a mechanical representation. The only misfortune
which attended this curious delineation was, that not
one of his parishioners could understand it: they
however, were silent; they thought it too serious
an affair to dispute or call names about. It would
perhaps have been as well if many of our learned and
right grave divines had been silent upon this subject
on the same principle.</p>

<p>Swift says that the jack was turned to a clock; in
this circumstance he must have been mistaken, for
the hour-glass, which was the constant companion of
Dame Baucis at her wheel, retains its old form, and
is placed at the parson's left hand.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Underneath it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
is the following applicable inscription from St. Paul's
Epistle to the Galatians: "I am afraid of you, lest I
have bestowed upon you labour in vain."</p>

<p>The windows are evidently intended for companions,
but there is a considerable difference in their
proportions, panes of glass, etc. At the time this
massy temple was erected, our countrymen neither
studied Vitruvius, nor considered uniformity as a
requisite in architecture.</p>

<p>This print was published on the 26th of October
1736; but we learn, by an inscription on the sinister
side of the plate, that on the 21st April 1762 it was
retouched and improved by the author.</p>

<p>There is a printed copy, tolerably executed, but
not quite so large, nor has it any price affixed beneath.</p>

<p>The original picture was in Sir Edward Walpole's
collection; who is the present proprietor I do not
know. There are some variations in it; the face of
the clerk is different from the print, and he does not
appear leering at the girl, but, to keep in unison with
the rest of the congregation, is half asleep.</p>

<h3>THE DISTRESSED POET.</h3>

<p class="drop-capx">Such is the fate of many a miserable scribbler
who usurps the sacred name of a
poet. Parnassus must be peopled, and
the fashionable versifiers that have no other aim than
feeding on the mountain have sometimes cropped
better pasturage at the foot of the hill than has been
found by those hallowed bards who have attained the
summit. Of gentle readers that demand the strains
of gentle writers, there are in this our city an innumerable
host. They are sober and well-disposed
persons, good subjects to their king, and useful
members of the community; but being by their
various avocations confined to a smoky town, are
debarred from the cheering prospects of purling
streams, waving woods, and shady groves. They
have nevertheless great comfort and delectation in
reading descriptions of scenes so profusely beautified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
with the amenities of nature. Happily for such admirers
of rural simplicity, there is a band of pastoral
poets who make the press groan with description.
Seated like this unfortunate labourer of the Muses
in their attic storey, and scarcely ever seeing a green
tree except in the Moorfields Mall, they daily present
the public with amplifications of verdant meads,
glistening dew-drops, and liquid rains. In the sublime
strains of these gentlemen,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The misty mountains lift their cloud-capt heads;</p>
<p class="verse">The enamell'd mead its velvet carpet spreads;</p>
<p class="verse">The groves appear all drest with wreaths of flowers,</p>
<p class="verse">And from their leaves drop aromatic showers."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Upon the same principle with our town-made
rhymers, who have generally written about things
which they have neither seen, felt, heard, nor understood,
this our distressed poet is now spinning a poem
upon riches. Of their use he probably knoweth little;
and of their abuse, if judgment can be formed from
externals, certes he knoweth less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Seated upon the side of his bed, without a shirt,
but wrapped in an old night-gown,&mdash;enchanted, impressed,
inspired with his subject,&mdash;he is disturbed
by a nymph of the Lactarium. Her shrill sounding
voice awakes one of the little loves, whose chorus
disturbs his meditations. A link of the golden chain
is broken!&mdash;a thought is lost! To recover it, his hand
becomes a substitute for the barber's comb: enraged
at the noise, he tortures his head for the fleeting idea;
but, ah! no thought is there!</p>

<p>Proudly conscious that the lines already written
are sterling, he possesses by anticipation the mines of
Peru, a view of which hangs over his head. Upon
the table we see Byshe's <cite>Art of Poetry</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> for, like
the packhorse who cannot travel without his bells,
he cannot climb the hill of Parnassus without his
jingling-book. On the floor lies the <cite>Grub Street
Journal</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> to which valuable repository of genius and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>taste he is probably a contributor. To show that he
is a master of the profound, and will envelope his
subject in a cloud, his pipe and tobacco-box&mdash;those
friends to cogitation deep&mdash;are close to him.</p>

<p>His wife, mending that part of his dress in the
pockets of which the affluent keep their gold, is
worthy of a better fate. Her figure is peculiarly
interesting.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Her face, softened by adversity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
marked with domestic care, is at this moment agitated
by the appearance of a boisterous woman,
insolently demanding payment of the milk-tally.
In the excuse she returns, there is a mixture of
concern, complacency, and mortification. As an
addition to the distresses of this poor family, a dog
is stealing the remnant of mutton incautiously left
upon a chair.</p>

<p>The sloping roof and projecting chimney prove
the throne of this inspired bard to be high above the
crowd;&mdash;it is a garret. The chimney is ornamented
with a dare for larks; and a book, a loaf, the tea-equipage,
and a saucepan, decorate the shelf. Before
the fire hangs half a shirt and a pair of ruffled sleeves.
His sword lies on the floor; for though our professor
of poetry waged no war, except with words, a sword
was in the year 1740 a necessary appendage to every
thing which called itself gentleman. At the feet of
his domestic seamstress, the full-dress coat is become
the resting-place of a cat and two kittens: in the same
situation is one stocking; the other is half immersed
in the washing-pan. The broom, bellows, and mop
are scattered round the room. The open door shows
us that their cupboard is unfurnished, and tenanted by
an hungry and solitary mouse. In the corner hangs
a long cloak, well calculated to conceal the threadbare
wardrobe of its fair owner.</p>

<p>Mr. Hogarth's strict attention to propriety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
scenery is evinced by the cracked plastering of the
walls, broken window, and uneven floor, in the miserable
habitation of this poor weaver of madrigals.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p class="drop-capx">The last plate displayed the distress of a
poet; in this the artist has exhibited the
rage of a musician. Our poor bard bore
his misfortunes with patience, and, rich in his Muse,
did not much repine at his poverty. Not so this
master of harmony&mdash;of heavenly harmony! To the
evils of poverty he is now a stranger; his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">adagios</i> and
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cantabiles</i> have procured him the protection of nobles;
and, contrary to the poor shirtless mendicant of the
Muses that we left in a garret, he is arrayed in a coat
decorated with frogs, a bag-wig, solitaire, and ruffled
shirt. Waiting in the chamber of a man of fashion,
whom he instructs in the divine science of music,
having first tuned his instrument, he opens his
crotchet-book, shoulders his violin, flourishes his
fiddlestick, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Softly sweet, in Lydian measure,</p>
<p class="verse">Soon he soothes his soul to pleasure."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Rapt in Elysium at the divine symphony, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
awakened from his beatific vision by noises that
distract him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">"An universal hubbub wild,</p>
<p class="verse">Of stunning sounds, and voices all confus'd,</p>
<p class="verse">Assails his ears with loudest vehemence."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Confounded with the din, and enraged by the interruption,
our modern Terpander starts from his seat,
and opens the window. This operates as air to a
kindling fire; and such a combination of noises burst
upon the auricular nerve that he is compelled to stop
his ears,&mdash;but to stop the torrent is impossible!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse4">"A louder yet, and yet a louder strain,</p>
<p class="verse">Break his bands of thought asunder!</p>
<p class="verse">And rouse him, like a rattling peal of thunder,</p>
<p class="verse4">At the horrible sound</p>
<p class="verse5">He has rais'd up his head,</p>
<p class="verse5">As awak'd from the dead,</p>
<p class="verse4">And amazed he stares all around."</p>
</div></div>

<p>In this situation he is delineated; and those who
for a moment contemplate the figures before him,
cannot wonder at his rage:</p>

<p class="verse">With wide Cerberean mouth, full loud, and ring</p>

<p>Of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> who perform the vocal
parts, the first is a fellow in a tone that would rend
hell's concave, bawling, "Dust, ho! dust, ho! dust!"
Next to him, an amphibious animal, who nightly
pillows his head on the sedgy bosom of old Thames,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>in a voice that emulates the rush of many waters,
or the roaring of a cataract, is bellowing, "Flounda-a-a-rs!"
A daughter of May-day, who dispenses
what in London is called milk, and is consequently a
<em>milkmaid</em>, in a note pitched at the very top of her
voice, is crying, "Be-louw!" While a ballad-singer
dolefully drawls out <em>The Ladie's Fall</em>, an infant in her
arms joins its treble pipe in chorus with the screaming
parrot, which is on a lamp-iron over her head.
On the roof of an opposite house are two cats, performing
what an amateur of music might perhaps call
a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bravura</i> duet; near them appears</p>

every stroke of his rammer adds a loud, distinct, and
echoing "Haugh!" The pedestrian cutler is grinding
a butcher's cleaver with such earnestness and
force, that it elicits sparks of fire. This, added to the
agonizing howls of his unfortunate dog, must afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crepitaculum</i>, or rattle, and the boy beating his drum,
conclude the catalogue of this harmonious band.</p>

<p>Thus much we may be almost said to hear; and
we see, by the flag displayed at the church, that the
fanciers of corals for grown gentlemen are performing
a round of double bob-majors in the belfry. "John
Long, pewterer," is inscribed over a door, and intimates
the business going on in the house, where the
strokes of some thirty or forty hammers ringing incessantly
upon pewter, produce a sound more sonorous
than that which is echoed from the forge of Vulcan.</p>

<p>This delineation originated in a story which was
told to Hogarth by the late Mr. John Festin,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> who is
the hero of the print. He was eminent for his skill
in playing upon the German flute and hautboy, and
much employed as a teacher of music. To each of his
scholars he devoted one hour each day. "At nine
o'clock in the morning," said he, "I once waited upon
my Lord Spencer; but his lordship being out of
town, from him I went to Mr. V&mdash;&mdash;n, now Lord
V&mdash;&mdash;n. It was so early, that he was not arisen. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>went into his chamber, and, opening a shutter, sat
down in the window-seat. Before the rails was a
fellow playing upon the hautboy. A man with a
barrow full of onions offered the piper an onion if he
would play him a tune. That ended, he offered a
second onion for a second tune; the same for a
third, and was going on: but this was too much,&mdash;I
could not bear it,&mdash;it angered my very soul&mdash;'Zounds!'
said I, 'stop here! This fellow is ridiculing
my profession&mdash;he is playing on the hautboy
for onions!'"</p>

<p>The whole of this <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bravura</i> scene is admirably represented.
A person quaintly enough observed that
it deafens one to look at it.</p>

<p>The roar of the fisherman, with one hand so placed
as to become a sort of sounding-board, and give reverberation,
is admirably depicted. You perceive
that he has, professionally speaking, not merely a
<em>volume</em>, but a <em>folio volume</em> of voice. As well as that
of the dustman, it is a thorough bass; and, added to
the tenor and treble of the other performers, must
form a concert, though not quite so harmonious, yet
nearly as loud, as those which have been graced with
the royal presence in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The scene seems to be taken from the lower part
of St. Martin's Lane; it is certainly intended to represent
the steeple of St. Martin's Church.</p>

<p>A heap of bricks, scientifically piled up close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
little girl, have been said to be a contrivance of some
boy to catch birds. Is it not more likely that the
modern architecture of this little Babel, as well as
the adjoining plantation and pond, originated in the
united efforts of the young lady and young gentleman
in a corner cap? The latter has been dragging
a slate fastened to a string, and tied round his waist,
over a rough pavement, that he also might make <em>a
pretty noise</em>.</p>

<p>A play-bill on the wall describes the unaccountable
run of that very popular and pernicious performance,
<cite>The Beggar's Opera</cite>, to have been sixty-two nights.
In a copy of this opera, published in 1729, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis
personæ</i> are printed as here written; and the good
fortune which followed Miss Fenton's attractions in
Polly are universally known.</p>

<p>The figures are well grouped and judiciously characterized:
those in the background have great force;
but the boy with a drum is ill drawn, and the milk-pail
is too large.</p>

<p>In the <cite>London Daily Post</cite> for November 24, 1740, is
the following advertisement:&mdash;"Shortly will be published,
a new print, called <cite>The Provoked Musician</cite>,
designed and engraved by Mr. William Hogarth;
being a companion to a print representing a Distressed
Poet, published some time since. To which
will be added, a third on painting, which will complete
the set; but as this subject may turn upon an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
affair depending between the Right Hon. the Lord
Mayor and the author, it may be retarded for some
time."</p>

<p>Humphry Parsons was at that time Lord Mayor;
but the business alluded to not being in the city
records, must remain obscure until some one who
knows more about it than I do shall explain it.</p>

<p>In Dr. Beattie's <cite>Essay on Laughter and Ludicrous
Composition</cite>, quarto edition, p. 608, speaking of the
modes of combination by which incongruous qualities
may be presented to the eye or the fancy, so as to
provoke laughter, he observes, that "this extraordinary
group form a very comical mixture of incongruity
and relation: of incongruity, owing to the
dissimilar employment and appearances of the several
persons, and to the variety of dissonance of their
respective noises; and of relation, owing to their being
all united in the same place, and for the same
purpose of tormenting the poor fiddler. From the
various sounds co-operating to this one end, the
piece becomes more laughable than if their meeting
were conceived to be without any particular destination;
for the greater number of relations, as well as
of contrarieties, that take place in any ludicrous
assembly, the more ludicrous it will generally appear.
Yet though this group comprehends not any mixture
of meanness and dignity, it would, I think, be allowed
to be laughable to a certain degree, merely from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
juxtaposition of the objects, even though it were supposed
to be accidental."</p>

<p>Of the immense fortunes realized by the Italian
professors of music, we have many examples in this
island; but the success of Lully, in France, was
greater than any of his countrymen ever experienced
here. He was by birth a Florentine. By his fiddle
and his impudence, he raised himself from the Queen
of France's kitchen to be chief of the band of music,
and carried the art to a degree of perfection hitherto
unknown in that kingdom. Louis <span class="fs70">XIV.</span> gave him
letters of nobility, and on his account enacted that the
profession of music should consist with the quality of
a gentleman. He died by excessive drinking, and
left an immense fortune. The nobleman who had
entertained him when he drank what proved his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quietus</i>, paying him a visit, "Ah! my lord," said his
wife, with a deep sigh, "you are the last who made
my husband drunk." Lully, who was dying, heard
the remark, and had just voice enough left to add,
"He shall be the first who makes me so again, when
I get upon my legs!"</p>

<h3>THE FOUR TIMES OF THE DAY.</h3>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_213.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In the "Progress of an Harlot," and the
"Adventures of a Rake," Mr. Hogarth
displayed his powers of painting history.
Holding the mirror up to Nature, he shows</p>

<p class="p1 fs80">"Virtue her own feature, Vice her own image, and the very age and
body of the time his form and pressure."</p>

<p class="noindent">Had he exhibited no other specimen of his art, these
fourteen prints would have given him a right to the
title of a moral painter; and thus was he denominated
by the late Mr. Fielding, in his <cite>Adventures of Joseph
Andrews</cite>.</p>

<p>In the series before us he treads poetic ground. A
description of the day, particularly the morning, has
been generally deemed the bard's peculiar province.
Considering Homer as the father of poesy, the whole
family of Apollo have echoed his notes, and run their
divisions of fancy upon his scale. With one of them,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The morn, wak'd by the circling hours,</p>
<p class="verse">Unbars the gates of light."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">With another, she "sows the earth with orient pearl."
At one time, with a star as her gentleman usher, she</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Draws night's humid curtains, and proclaims</p>
<p class="verse">The new-born day forth dawning from the east;"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">is now the grey Aurora, then the meek-ey'd morn,
array'd in a dewy robe, with saffron streamers, placed
in a glittering chariot, and drawn by etherial coursers,
where, holding the reins with her red hands, <em>she drives
the day</em>.</p>

<p>These heathenish descriptions may be very beautiful
in their way; but hear our own Shakspeare:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Night's tapers are burnt out, and jocund day</p>
<p class="verse">Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain's top."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,</p>
<p class="verse">And 'gins to pale her ineffectual fire."</p>
</div></div>

<p>This comes home to all men's business and bosoms:
it is picturesque, it is poetical; it is intelligible to the
peasant or the philosopher, to the classic admirer of
ancient mythology, or the man who never heard that
the gates which Aurora unbars are made of the purest
crystal.</p>

<p>The pictures drawn by Homer, and those feeble
imitators who debase his splendid images by the mixture
of their own dross, have their scenes laid in the
country; but Hogarth has represented his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis
personæ</i> in the centre of a great city. Had the learned
author of <cite>Hudibras</cite> been a painter, I believe he would
have done the same. It will not be easy to select two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
lines that have more wit than his description of the
morning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Now, like a lobster boil'd, the morn</p>
<p class="verse">From black to red began to turn."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This is appropriate to either city or country.</p>

<p>In Mr. Hogarth's "Four Times of the Day" there
is only one scene laid out of town; and that may, I
think, be properly enough called a London pastoral,
for it is at the pleasant village of Islington. The three
others are described as in the most public parts of the
metropolis, and exhibit a picture which will give a
very correct idea of the dresses and pursuits of the
inhabitants of London in the year 1738.</p>

<p class="noindent">This withered representative of Miss Bridget Alworthy,
with a shivering footboy carrying her prayer-book,
never fails in her attendance at morning service.
She is a symbol of the season,</p>

<p class="noindent">she looks with scowling eye, and all the conscious
pride of severe and stubborn virginity, on the poor
girls who are suffering the embraces of two drunken
beaux that are just staggered out of Tom King's
Coffeehouse. One of them, from the basket on her
arm, I conjecture to be an orange girl: she shows no
displeasure at the boisterous salute of her Hibernian
lover. That the hero in a laced hat is from the banks
of the Shannon, is apparent in his countenance. The
female whose face is partly concealed, and whose
neck has a more easy turn than we always see in the
works of this artist, is not formed of the most inflexible
materials.</p>

<p>An old woman, seated upon a basket; the girl,
warming her hands by a few withered sticks that are
blazing on the ground; and a wretched mendicant,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
wrapped in a tattered and party-coloured blanket,
entreating charity from the rosy-fingered vestal who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>is going to church, complete the group. Behind them,
at the door of Tom King's Coffeehouse, are a party
engaged in a fray likely to create business for both
surgeon and magistrate; we discover swords and
cudgels in the combatants' hands.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the print are two little
schoolboys. That they have shining morning faces
we cannot positively assert, but each has a satchel at
his back, and, according with the description given by
the poet of nature, is</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Creeping like snail unwillingly to school."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The lantern appended to the woman who has a
basket on her head, proves that these dispensers of
the riches of Pomona rise before the sun, and do part
of their business by an <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'artifical light'">artificial light</ins>. Near her, that
immediate descendant of Paracelsus, Doctor Rock,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> is
expatiating to an admiring audience on the never-failing
virtues of his wonder-working medicines. One
hand holds a bottle of his miraculous panacea, and the
other supports a board, on which is the king's arms, to
indicate that his practice is sanctioned by royal letters
patent. Two porringers and a spoon, placed on the
bottom of an inverted basket, intimate that the woman
seated near them is a vendor of rice-milk, which was
at that time brought into the market every morning.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>A fatigued porter leans on a rail; and a blind
beggar is going towards the church: but whether he
will become one of the congregation, or take his
stand at the door, in the hope that religion may have
warmed the hearts of its votaries to "pity the sorrows
of a poor blind man," is uncertain.</p>

<p>The clock in the front of Inigo Jones' barn has
the motto, "<span class="fs80">SIC TRANSIT GLORIA MUNDI</span>." Had
Mr. Hervey of Weston Favel written upon the
works of Hogarth, he would have expatiated for ten
pages upon the relation which this motto has to the
smoke which is issuing from the chimney beneath;
he would have written about it, and about it, and told
his readers that the glory of this world is typified by
the smoke, and like the smoke it passeth away; that
man himself is a mere vapour, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Snow on the ground, and icicles hanging from the
pent-house, exhibit a very chilling prospect; but, to
dissipate the cold, there is happily a shop where
spirituous liquors are sold <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro bono publico</i>, at a very
little distance. A large pewter measure is placed
upon a post before the door, and three of a smaller
size hung over the window of the house.</p>

<p>The character of the principal figure<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> is admirably
delineated. She is marked with that prim and
awkward formality which generally accompanies her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
order, and is an exact type of a hard winter; for
every part of her dress, except the flying lappets and
apron, ruffled by the wind, is as rigidly precise as if
it were frozen. Extreme cold is very well expressed
in the slipshod footboy,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and the girl who is warming
her hands. The group of which she is a part
is well formed, but not sufficiently balanced on the
opposite side.</p>

<p>The church dial, a few minutes before seven; marks
of little shoes and pattens in the snow; and various
productions of the season in the market, are an additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
proof of that minute accuracy with which this
artist inspected and represented objects which painters
in general have neglected.</p>

<p>Covent Garden is the scene, but in the print every
building is reversed.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> This was a common error with
Hogarth; not from his being ignorant of the use of
the mirror, but from his considering it as a matter of
little consequence.</p>

<p>The propriety of exhibiting a scene of riot in Tom
King's Coffeehouse is proved by the following quotation
from the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> for June 9, 1739:&mdash;"<em>Monday</em>,
Mrs. Mary King, of Covent Garden, was
brought up to the King's Bench bar, at Westminster,
and received the following sentence for keeping a disorderly
house, viz. to pay a fine of two hundred pounds,
to suffer three months' imprisonment, to find security
for her good behaviour for three years, and to remain
in prison till the fine be paid." When her imprisonment
ended, she retired from trade, built three houses
on Haverstock Hill, near Hampstead, and in one of
them, on the 10th of September 1747, she died. Her
mansion was afterwards the residence of Nancy
Dawson, and with the two others constitutes what is
still distinguished by the appellation of Moll King's
Row.</p>

<p class="noindent">Among the figures who are coming out of church,
an affected, flighty Frenchwoman, with her fluttering
fop of an husband, and a boy, habited <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à-la-mode
de Paris</i>, claim our first attention. In dress,
air, and manner, they have a national character.
The whole congregation, whether male or female,
old or young, carry the air of their country in
countenance, dress, and deportment. Like the three
principal figures, they are all marked with some
affected peculiarity. Affectation in a woman is supportable
upon no other ground than that general
indulgence we pay to the omnipotence of beauty,
which in a degree sanctifies whatever it adopts. In a
boy, when we consider that the poor fellow is attempting
to copy what he has been taught to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
praiseworthy, we laugh at it&mdash;the largest portion of
ridicule falls upon his tutors; but in a man, it is contemptible!</p>

<p>The old fellow in a black periwig has a most
vinegar-like aspect, and looks with great contempt at
the frippery gentlewoman immediately before him.
The woman with a demure countenance seems very
piously considering how she can contrive to pick the
embroidered beau's pocket. Two old sibyls joining
their withered lips in a chaste salute, is nauseous
enough, but, being a national custom, must be forgiven.
The divine seems to have resided in this
kingdom long enough to acquire a roast-beef countenance.
A little boy, whose woollen night-cap is
pressed over a most venerable flowing periwig, and the
decrepid old man, leaning upon a crutch-stick, who is
walking before him, I once considered as two vile
caricatures, out of nature, and unworthy the artist.
Since I have seen the peasantry of Flanders and the
plebeian youth of France, I have in some degree
changed my opinion, but still think them rather <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>.</p>

<p>Under a sign of the Baptist's Head is written,
"Good Eating;" and on each side of the inscription
is a mutton chop. In opposition to this head without
a body, unaccountably displayed as a sign at an
eating-house, there is a body without a head, hanging
out as the sign of a distiller's. This, by common
consent, has been quaintly denominated "The Good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>Woman."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> At a window above, one of the <em>softer sex</em>
proves her indisputable right to the title by her
temperate conduct to her husband, with whom having
had a little disagreement, she throws their
Sunday's dinner into the street.</p>

<p>A girl, bringing a pie from the bakehouse, is
stopped in her career by the rude embraces of a
blackamoor, who eagerly rubs his sable visage against
her blooming cheek.</p>

<p>Good eating is carried on to the lower part of the
picture. A boy,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> placing a baked pudding upon a
post with rather too violent an action, the dish
breaks, the fragments fall to the ground; and while
he is loudly lamenting his misfortune, and with
tears anticipating his punishment, the smoking remnants
are eagerly snatched up by a poor girl. Not
educated according to the system of Jean Jacques
Rousseau, she feels no qualms of conscience about
the original proprietor, and destitute of that fastidious
delicacy which destroys the relish of many a fine
lady, eagerly swallows the hot and delicious morsels
with all the concomitants.</p>

<p>The scene is laid at the door of a French chapel
in Hog Lane,&mdash;a part of the town at that time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>almost wholly peopled by French refugees or their
descendants.</p>

<p>A kite blown from an adjacent field,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> being entangled
on the roof of the chapel, hangs pendant
on the wall. One of Mr. Hogarth's commentators
asserts, that "this is introduced only to break the
disagreeable uniformity of a wall."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> It certainly has
that effect; but Hogarth so rarely presents any
object without a particular and pointed allusion, that
I am inclined to think he had some other meaning.
May it not be designed to intimate that the good
people who compose the congregation, after being
blown out of their own country by a religious storm,
found a peaceful harbour under this roof, safely
sheltered from the hurricanes of enthusiasm and the
blasts of superstition?</p>

<p>By the dial of St. Giles' Church, in the distance,
we see that it is only half-past eleven. At this early
hour, in those good times, there was as much good
eating as there is now at six o'clock in the evening.
From twenty pewter measures, which are hung up
before the houses of different distillers, it seems that
good drinking was considered as equally worthy of
their serious attention.</p>

<p>The dead cat and choked kennels mark the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>attention shown to the streets by the scavengers of
St. Giles'. At that time noxious effluvia was not
peculiar to this parish. The neighbourhood of Fleet
Ditch, and many other parts of the city, were equally
polluted.</p>

<p>Even at this refined period, there would be some
use in a more strict attention to the medical police
of a city so crowded with inhabitants. We ridicule
the people of Paris and Edinburgh for neglecting so
essential and salutary a branch of delicacy, while the
kennels of a street in the vicinity of St. Paul's Church
are floated with the blood of slaughtered animals
every market day. Moses would have managed
these things better: but in those days there was no
<em>physician in Israel</em>!</p>

<div class="caption">EVENING.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is not easy to imagine fatigue better delineated
than in the appearance of this amiable pair. In
a few of the earliest impressions, Mr. Hogarth
printed the hands of the man in blue, to show
that he was a dyer, and the face and neck of the
woman in red, to intimate her extreme heat.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The
lady's aspect lets us at once into her character;
we are certain that she was born to command.
As to her husband, "God made him, and he must
pass for a man;" what his wife has made him is
indicated by the cow's horns, which are so placed
as to become his own. The hope of the family, with
a cockade in his hat, and riding upon papa's cane,
seems much dissatisfied with female sway. A face
with more of the shrew in embryo than that of the
girl, it is scarcely possible to conceive. Upon such a
character, the most casual observer pronounces with
the decision of a Lavater.</p>

<p>Nothing can be better imagined than the group in
the alehouse. They have taken a refreshing walk into
the country, and, being determined to have a cooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
pipe, seat themselves in a chair-lumbered closet with
a low ceiling; where every man pulling off his wig,
and throwing a pocket-handkerchief over his head,
inhales the fume of hot punch, the smoke of half a
dozen pipes, and the dust from the road. If this is
not rural felicity, what is? The old gentleman in a
black bag-wig, and the two women near him, sensibly
enough, take their seats in the open air.</p>

<p>From a woman milking a cow, we conjecture the
hour to be about five in the afternoon; and from the
same circumstance, I am inclined to think this agreeable
party are going to their pastoral bower rather
than returning from it.</p>

<p>The cow and dog appear as much inconvenienced
by heat as any of the party: the former is whisking
off the flies; and the latter creeps unwillingly along,
and casts a longing look at the crystal river in which
he sees his own shadow. A remarkably hot summer
is intimated by the luxuriant state of a vine creeping
over an alehouse window. On the side of the New
River, where the scene is laid, lies one of the wooden
pipes employed in the waterworks. Opposite Sadler's
Wells there still remains a sign<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> of Sir Hugh
Middleton's head, which is here represented.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p>This print is engraved by Baron, but some touches
of Mr. Hogarth's <em>burin</em> are visible on the faces.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, I think it is, who observes, that an
ardent pursuit of pleasure generally defeats its own
purpose; for when we have wasted days and nights,
and exhausted our strength in the chase, it eludes
our grasp, and vanishes from our view.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Mr. Walpole very truly observes, that this print
is inferior to the three others; there is, however,
broad humour in some of the figures.</p>

<p>The wounded freemason, who, in zeal of brotherly
love, has drank his bumpers to the craft till he is unable
to find his way home, is under the guidance of a
waiter. This has been generally considered as intended
for Sir Thomas de Veil, and, from an authenticated
portrait which I have seen, I am inclined to
think it is, notwithstanding Sir John Hawkins asserts
that "he could discover no resemblance." When the
knight saw him in his magisterial capacity, he was
probably sober and sedate: here he is represented a
little disguised. The British Xantippe showering her
favours from the window upon his head, may have
its source in that respect which the inmates of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>houses as the Rummer Tavern had for a justice of
peace.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The waiter who supports his worship seems, from
the patch upon his forehead, to have been in a recent
affray; but what use he can have for a lantern it is
not easy to divine, unless he is conducting his charge
to some place where there is neither moonlight nor
illumination.</p>

<p>The Salisbury flying coach oversetting and broken,
by passing through the bonfire, is said to be an intended
burlesque upon a right honourable peer, who
was accustomed to drive his own carriage over hedges,
ditches, and rivers; and has been sometimes known
to drive three or four of his maid-servants into a deep
water, and there leave them in the coach to shift for
themselves.</p>

<p>The butcher and little fellow who are assisting the
terrified passengers, are possibly <em>free</em> and <em>accepted</em>
masons. One of them seems to have a mop in his
hand;&mdash;the pail is out of sight!</p>

<p>To crown the joys of the populace, a man with a
pipe in his mouth is filling a capacious hogshead with
British Burgundy.</p>

<p>The joint operation of shaving and bleeding, performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by a drunken 'prentice on a greasy oilman,
does not seem a very natural exhibition on a rejoicing
night.</p>

<p>The poor wretches under the barber's bench display
a prospect of penury and wretchedness which I hope
is not so common now as it was then.</p>

<p>In the distance is a cart laden with furniture, which
some unfortunate tenant is removing out of the reach
of his landlord's execution.</p>

<p>There is humour in the barber's sign and inscription:
"Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a
touch. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecce signum!</i>"</p>

<p>The Rummer Tavern still retains its old situation.
It was then quaintly distinguished as the <span class="smcap">New
Bagnio</span>.</p>

<p>By the oaken boughs on the sign, and the oak
leaves in the freemasons' hats, it seems that this rejoicing
night is the 29th of May, the anniversary of
our second Charles's restoration; that happy day
when, according to our excellent old ballad, "the
king enjoyed his own again." This might be one
reason for the artist choosing a scene contiguous to
the beautiful equestrian statue<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> of Charles <span class="fs80">I.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>In the distance we see a house on fire,&mdash;an accident
very likely to happen on such a night as this.</p>

<p>The original pictures of "Morning" and "Noon"
were sold to the Duke of Ancaster for fifty-seven
guineas; "Evening" and "Night" to Sir William
Heathcote for sixty-four guineas.</p>

<h3>STROLLING PLAYERS.</h3>

<p class="xxs">&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_234.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">As the Act prohibiting performance of any
play or interlude which was not sanctioned
by the Lord Chamberlain passed about
the time that this print was published, and is particularly
referred to in the engraving, a short view of the
English drama, and the circumstances which occasioned
the Bill's being brought into the House of
Commons, seems immediately connected with the
subject.</p>

<p>Our first theatrical exhibitions had a religious tendency;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
they were under the direction of the clergy,
represented a story compiled from the Bible, or some
legendary tale of a canonized saint, and were denominated
mysteries. In the year 1378, the scholars
of Paul's School presented a petition to Richard <span class="fs80">II.</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
praying his Majesty to prohibit some unexpert people
from presenting the History of the Old Testament, to
the great prejudice of the clergy, who had been at much
expense in order to represent it publicly at Christmas.
In 1390, interludes were played at Skinner's Well;
and again, in 1409, the parish clerks of London performed
plays for eight days successively at Clerkenwell,
which took its name from these right learned
and worthy performers. Their play had for its subject
the creation of the world, and was honoured with
the presence of most of the nobility in the kingdom,
and very many gentry also attended. This unenlightened
period has been properly called "the dead
sleep of the Muses." They did not presently awake:
the moralities which followed were produced in a
kind of morning dream. They, however, had some
shadow of meaning, which is more than can be said
of the exhibitions which preceded them. The mysteries
represented, in a confused and senseless manner,
some incredible tale; but in the moralities a plan
was aimed at, and something like poetry was attempted.
The virtues, vices, and affections of the
mind were frequently personified; good actions were
rewarded, and wickedness chastised. Religion was
at that time professed to be the leading object, and
even their amusements had a tendency to promote it:
were moralities performed now, they would unquestionably
turn upon politics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>In the reign of that <em>most righteous</em> prince Henry
<span class="fs80">VIII.</span>, very properly distinguished from the monarchs
who preceded him as "Defender of the Faith," and
so forth, an Act was made for the promoting of true
religion. In this Act a clause is inserted, "restraining
all rimours or plaiers from singing in songs, or playing
in interludes, anything that should contradict the
acknowledged doctrines."</p>

<p>It was customary at this time to enact these moral
and religious dramas in private houses; and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> were so contrived, that five or six
actors might represent twenty characters. "Players,"
says honest John Stowe, "were in former times retainers
to noblemen; and none had the privilege to
act plays but such as were so retained. These
divertissements were then a recreation, and used,
therefore, now and then occasionally; but afterwards,
by abuse, they became a trade and calling, and so
remain unto this day."</p>

<p>In 1574, Sir James Hawes being Mayor, the Common
Council of London passed an Act, wherein it was
ordained that no play should be openly acted within
the liberties of the city, wherein should be uttered
any words, examples, or doings, of any unchastity,
sedition, or such like unfit or uncomely matters, under
the penalty of five pounds, and fourteen days' imprisonment.
And further, that no plays should be
acted till first perused and allowed by the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Mayor and Court of Aldermen. But even these
sagacious and judicious laws failed in their effect, for
the drama remained not only dead, dull, and unprofitable,
but depraved; when, like the sun bursting
through a cloud,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse6">"Immortal Shakspeare rose;</p>
<p class="verse">Each change of many-colour'd life he drew,</p>
<p class="verse">Exhausted worlds, and then imagin'd new:</p>
<p class="verse">Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,</p>
<p class="verse">And panting Time toil'd after him in vain:</p>
<p class="verse">His pow'rful strokes presiding truth confess'd,</p>
<p class="verse">And unresisted passion storm'd the breast."</p>
</div></div>

<p>From that period to this, theatrical amusements
have undergone many changes, which do not come
into my plan to relate, and the Legislature have passed
many Acts to check their licentiousness, which it is
not my province to enumerate.</p>

<p>A short time previous to the publication of this
print, our dramatic writers thought proper to dip
their pens in the sea of politics. To check this growing
evil, it has been said that the minister contrived
to have a very indecent performance (fabricated for
the express purpose of showing the enormities of
writers for the theatre) presented to one of the
managers. It was brought from the manager to the
minister, shown to a number of persons in power, and
made a pretence for bringing in a Bill to prohibit the
performance of any play or interlude until it had
been perused and received the sanction of the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Chamberlain for the time being. By the friends of
the ministers of that day this account has been contradicted.
They assert that a piece called the <cite>Golden
Rump</cite>, containing much personal abuse of George
<span class="fs70">II.</span> and Queen Caroline, was on the point of being
acted at the theatre in the Haymarket. Sir Robert
Walpole having notice of it, procured a copy, in consequence
of which the performance was stopped, and
the Act passed. It was introduced as intended to
explain, amend, and enforce so much of an Act made
in the twelfth year of the reign of Queen Anne as
related to rogues, vagabonds, and common players
of interludes.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield, in a very long speech, reprobated
the principle upon which it was founded, and exerted
all his eloquence to prevent its passing into a law.
This oration gave a temporary popularity to the
speaker, but did not serve the cause for which it
was made. The Bill passed; but the people were so
irritated that the power which it gave the Lord
Chamberlain should be exerted in favour of foreigners,
that in the year 1738, when some French actors,
authorized by his licence, attempted to perform a
French play at the Haymarket, a mob in the street
broke the windows, and attempted to pull down the
house, though many persons of high rank, and the
French ambassador, were in the boxes.</p>

<p>The print to which this little account is introduc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>tory,
receives a title from its female performers only;
and yet in this theatrical house of <em>commons</em> we discover
at least four representatives of the other sex,
viz. Apollo, Cupid, and two male devils.</p>

for wit and imagination, without any other

Hogarth's works; and Rouquet, in the only mention

the state dressing-room of a strolling company.
Here at one hour the gallant Hotspur laces on his
leathern armour, and at another the lively Beatrice
laces on her stays. The time is evening, and the
actors from the London theatres are preparing to
perform a farce, which, by the play-bill, is declared
to be <em>The Devil to pay in Heaven</em>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>
are principally deities, and deities of the first
order. On the bill are the names of Jupiter, Juno,
Diana, Flora, Night, Siren, Aurora, Eagle, Cupid,
two devils, a ghost, and attendants. To this divine
catalogue is added rope-dancing, tumbling, etc. The
inferior performers are: two musical kittens, a pair

occasionally serve for a triumphal car, a lady, who

Descended from her ebon car, with a sooty face, and
star-bespangled robe sweeping the ground, the sable
goddess Night is mending her majesty's stocking.
The Star of Evening, which sheds its sober light above
her head, is apparently formed of a brass instrument
used in making pastry. A venerable female, with
one eye, who by the dagger in her mantle we conjecture
to be the Tragic Muse,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> is cutting off a cat's tail,

<p class="noindent">But this savage amputation, which seems to excite no
emotion in the operator, is warmly resented by the
feline sufferer, who, enraged at the pain, revenges this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
barbarous indignity by tearing, with teeth and talons,

Shakspeare,</p>

<p>Two little devils, with horns just budded, are
eagerly contesting the right in a flagon of ale, out of
which one is drinking, and seems determined to get
to the bottom, if it were a mile. The flagon has been
placed on a Grecian altar, with a loaf of bread and a
pipe of tobacco, which being still lighted, the smoke
ascends in curling eddies; the grateful incense is inhaled
by all present,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"And heavenly fragrance fills the circuit wide."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The fascinating female stripped to her chemise, her
head decorated with feathers and flowers, is marked
by her crescent to be the goddess of the silver bow&mdash;the
chaste Diana. A principal figure in the picture,
with one foot resting upon her hoop, the other behind
the altar,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse6">"She stands like feather'd Mercury</p>
<p class="verse">New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">impressed with the dignity of her character, and inspired
with divine fervour, she is rehearsing her part.
At her right hand the blooming Flora is seated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
her toilet: and the toilet of Flora is a wicker hamper,
to which is appended a label inscribed <em>Jewels</em>; from
whence we may naturally infer that it contains the
glittering regalia of the company. "Her robe of
various dyes" is carelessly thrown over it as a veil;
and placed upon it is somewhat like part of a coffee-mill
with a candle in it, a broken looking-glass, a
broken ivory comb, and an oyster-shell, containing
what Mr. Warren emphatically calls "love-inspiring
rouge," "to dye the white rose to a bloody red."
One hand holds a candle, with which she delicately
pastes up her hair&mdash;"sweets to the sweet!" the other
grasps a dredger to powder her head.</p>

<p>Apollo and Cupid are jointly engaged in reaching
down a pair of stockings that are hung to dry on a
cloud. The little archer&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,</p>
<p class="verse">The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,</p>
<p class="verse">Liege of all loiterers and malcontents"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">the little archer has wings, but they will not exalt
him to the clouded canopy; he is obliged to mount a
ladder.</p>

<p>On the ground, beneath him, is Aurora, designated
by "the bright morning star, day's harbinger," glittering
in her hair. Her rosy fingers are employed in the
service of the charming though intoxicated siren,
who offers the hero (that is perhaps intended to per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>sonate
Ganymede) a glass of spirits. This the cupbearer
of Jupiter very gladly accepts, in the hope of
relief from an aching tooth, the agony of which is
intimated by his countenance, and the handkerchief,
which was once lost by the chaste Desdemona, being
held up to his face:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"There was never yet philosopher</p>
<p class="verse">That could endure the toothache patiently;</p>
<p class="verse">However they have writ the style of gods,</p>
<p class="verse">And made a pish at chance and sufferance."</p>
</div></div>

<p>In one corner a lady, who personates Jove's eagle,
is feeding a child.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse7">"Within the hollow crown</p>
<p class="verse">That rounds the mortal temples of a king,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">is placed a tin saucepan with the infant's food. The
child, terrified with the enormous beak hanging over
its head, refuses the proffered nourishment. This
crown once pressed the brow of haughty Bolingbroke:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"And when young Harry did the crown purloin,</p>
<p class="verse">He wept&mdash;because it was not current coin."</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the other corner, a monkey, in a long cloak, a
bag-wig, and solitaire, is degrading the plumed helmet
of Alexander.</p>

<p>Two kittens seem happily engaged: one of them,
in a style that shows she has a fine finger, "touches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the trembling lyre;" the other rolls an orb imperial.
Near them are a number of balls,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and two cups;
which intimate that this company of comedians practise
sleight of hand, and to fill their house will sometimes
condescend to play legerdemain tricks. In the
same part of the print are three emblems of the
law&mdash;two judges' periwigs, and a halter.</p>

<p>A mitre filled with tragedies and farces, and a dark
lantern, are placed upon a pulpit-cushion. Whether
the artist intended these for symbols of the church,
and designed to hint at the dark cloud which long
enveloped the mysteries of religion, or had any other
meaning, must be determined by those who have
studied polemic divinity, and considered ecclesiastical
history.</p>

<p>A trunk, which has occasionally served for the
concealment of Iachimo, and been displayed as the
coffin of Juliet, is now placed with the end upwards,
and become the reading-desk of the ox-eyed Juno.
Upon it is a tinder-box, and the thunderbolt of Jove,
a salt-box, and a rolling-pin. The two last articles
have much importance in the catalogue of the properties
of their orchestra. Their leading musical instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the sonorous bass-viol, leans against the
altar, and the sweet-sounding lyre lies on the floor.</p>

<p>Ten small tallow candles, stuck in clay, will be
fastened to a hoop, which, suspended by a packthread
over the centre of the stage, must form a most magnificent
chandelier.</p>

<p>On that bed which has been pressed by the gentle
Desdemona, and softened the sleep of beauteous
Imogen, are two play-bills and four eggs. One of
the eggs is broken: the others may perhaps be intended
to render the silver-toned siren's voice more
softly musical.</p>

<p>Two sets of waves, which gave the tempest-tossed
vessel an appearance of being suspended</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"'Twixt the green sea and cloudy canopy</p>
<p class="verse">Of o'er-arching heaven,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">are in a dead calm, resting against the wall. One
of them is become the roosting place of a hen and
chickens.</p>

<p>The frieze, festooned column, and arched door, form
part of their grand scene; but they, as well as the
vase with flowers, are in too elegant a style for their
accompaniments.</p>

<p>The spirit-stirring drum, martial trumpet, and
enchanted besom, make an admirable trophy. The
two first may serve to call the shallow Richmond to
arms, or rouse Macbeth to more than mortal deeds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the latter is unquestionably used in the incantations
of Hecate, and may be sometimes bestrid by one of
the weird sisters, to "ride in the whirlwind, and direct
the storm."</p>

<p>The two dragons will astonish a rustic audience;
and the rattling car, rolled over elastic planks, will
make dreadful thunder.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The British flag must wave for every nation upon
earth;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> may be borne before Macedonia's madman
in his triumphal entry, or wave upon the battlements
of Macbeth's castle. It is either the ensign of Henry
or the standard of Coriolanus.</p>

<p>The straw deposited in a corner may serve for the
bed of Lear, the head of Edgar, or the hands of the
fair Ophelia.</p>

<p>Canopied by an opaque cloud, inscribed "Oedipus"
and "Jocasta," and evidently intended as a scene in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>Lee's mad play,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> we discover the heads of two figures
reposing in the straw, instead of the garden, "as was
their custom in the afternoon."</p>

<p>A fellow, clambered to the top of the barn, is profanely
prying into the hallowed mysteries of the
green-room. A little lower is the Roman eagle and
standard; close to them a paint-pot, palette, and
pencils. The very natural appearance of two rural
scenes which lean against the wooden wall, evince that
some eminent artist has united the two professions,
and is both painter and hero to the company. "Hills
and dales are of his dressing." He can delineate the
blasted oak or nodding turret, the lofty castle or
humble cottage, with such brilliancy of colouring and
splendour of effect, that the astonished connoisseur
sometimes exclaims,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"There is something in this more than nature,</p>
<p class="verse">If philosophy could find it out."</p>
</div></div>

<p>A target, close to the altar, is richly embossed with
Medusa's head. A salt-box, before the divine Juno,
is chalked with hieroglyphic marks that might have
been originally made by this sovereign daughter of
the drama as a check upon an alehouse score. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
economical attention to Cocker's <cite>Arithmetic</cite> is very
necessary with even a royal revenue; for</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The chemise, apron, cap, and ruffles, hanging upon
a rope to dry, display marks of a laudable industry,
and prove that these dignified personages, maugre
their exalted rank, wash their own linen. The
gridiron, close to the bed, intimates that they are not
above broiling their own beefsteaks.</p>

<p>The expression of the figures in this print is admirable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Nothing can exceed the mock-heroic dignity
of Juno;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> she is as haughty as one of her own
peacocks. The Tragic Muse has been so frequently
up to the ears in blood, that she laughs at the tortures
of the poor quadruped whose tail she is cutting off.
The faces of the tumbler, the cat, and the Medusa, in
beauty and character, "contend for mastery."</p>

<p>A little devil, who has his fist clenched, and
threatens the other for drinking so deep, is admirably
marked; from the eyes of his twin-brother, with the
vessel to his mouth, we see that he highly relishes
and greedily inhales the delicious draught.</p>

<p>The group, formed by the five preceding characters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
is well composed, and their various dispositions most
forcibly delineated. In the ranting representative of
the pale moon, unblushing, unabashed impudence;
in the siren, mawkish intoxication; and in Ganymede,
an appearance of that agony which arises from the
toothache.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the candle that is near setting fire
to the hamper of jewels, we see through a breach in
the thatch that this is a daylight picture; in so shattered
a tenement, it is not easy to determine from
what source the figures are illuminated.</p>

<p>From the Act of Parliament which lies upon the
bed, we learn that this diabolical drama will be their
last performance; and when this abstract and brief
chronicle of the times have fretted their little hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
upon the stage, and made their exit, the barn will
be appropriated to its proper uses:</p>

<h3>MR. GARRICK IN THE CHARACTER OF RICHARD III.</h3>

<p class="verse">Have mercy, Jesu!&mdash;Soft; I did but dream.&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">The lights burn blue!&mdash;Is it not dead midnight?</p>
<p class="verse">Cold, fearful drops hang on my trembling flesh."</p>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">GARRICK AS RICHARD III.</div>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_255.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">Such is the exclamation of Richard, and
such is the disposition of his mind at the
moment of this delineation. In character
and expression of countenance the artist has succeeded,
but in resemblance&mdash;he has failed. The features
have no likeness to the features of Mr. Garrick,
and the figure gives an idea of a larger and more
muscular man. The lamp, diffusing a dim religious
light through the tent, the crucifix placed at his head,
the crown and unsheathed sword at his hand, and
the armour lying on the ground, are judicious and
appropriate accompaniments. His helmet is crested
with <em>a boar passant</em>, the armorial ensign of his family.
Near it lies a piece of paper, on which is written,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,</p>
<p class="verse">For Dickon thy master is bought and sold."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This paper was put in the Duke of Norfolk's tent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
night before the engagement; but not being brought
to Richard until after the time represented in this
scene, can only be admitted by that poetical licence
which has been generally allowed to poets and
painters.</p>

<p>The figures in the distance, two of whom,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Like sacrifices by their fires of watch,</p>
<p class="verse">With patience sit, and inly ruminate</p>
<p class="verse">The morning's danger,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">are properly introduced, and highly descriptive.</p>

<p>The tents of Richmond are so near,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"That the fix'd sentinels almost receive</p>
<p class="verse">The secret whispers of each other's watch."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Considered as a whole, the composition is simple,
and the figures well drawn. The drapery illustrates
his own precepts in the <cite>Analysis</cite>, where he says: "The
robes of state are always made large and full, because
they give a grandeur of appearance suitable to offices
of the greatest distinction. The judges' robes have
an awful dignity given them by the quantity of their
contents; and when the train is held up, there is a
noble waving line descending from the shoulders of
the judge to the hand of his train-bearer. So, when
the train is gently thrown aside, it generally falls into
a great variety of folds, which again employ the eye,
and fix its attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"The grandeur of the Eastern dress, which so far
surpasses the European, depends as much on quantity
as costliness. In a word, it is quantity which adds
greatness to grace."</p>

<p>There was some propriety in Hogarth choosing to
paint Mr. Garrick in this character. It was the first
he appeared in, on the 19th of October 1741, at Goodman's
Fields, and his performance gave proof of
talents which merited the celebrity he afterwards attained.
At that time Quin was the popular player;
but his laboured action, hollow tones, and the manner
in which he heaved up his words, were not borne
after Garrick's easy, familiar, and yet forcible style
had been seen by the town. The surly actor's remark
upon this heresy of the critics was, that "all
this was a new religion; but though Whitfield was
followed for a time, the people would soon return to
the true church." Garrick's epigram, in reply, has
some point:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Poor Quin, who damns all churches but his own,</p>
<p class="verse">Complains that heresy corrupts the town:</p>
<p class="verse">'Schism,' he cries, 'has turned the nation's brain;</p>
<p class="verse">But eyes will open,&mdash;and to church again!'</p>
<p class="verse">Thou great infallible forbear to roar,</p>
<p class="verse">Thy bulls and errors are rever'd no more;</p>
<p class="verse">When doctrines meet with general approbation,</p>
<p class="verse">It is not heresy, but reformation."</p>
</div></div>

<p>His soliloquy, written in the character of Quin, on
seeing <em>Duke Humphrey</em> at St. Albans, has humour:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"A plague on Egypt's arts, I say,</p>
<p class="verse">Embalm the dead!&mdash;on senseless clay</p>
<p class="verse4">Rich wines and spices waste!</p>
<p class="verse">Like sturgeon, or like brawn, shall I</p>
<p class="verse">Drown'd in a precious pickle lie,</p>
<p class="verse4">Which I can never taste!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p>By Lord Orrery's<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> persuasions, Mr. Pope went to
Goodman's Fields and saw Garrick in the first dawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of his fame. This great poet, who had formed his
taste upon the solemn and dignified elevation of
voice which distinguished Betterton (to whom he was
so partial, that he once painted his portrait, which,
until it was burnt in the riots of 1780, was in the possession
of Lord Mansfield);&mdash;this great poet was so
struck with the natural elocution of Mr. Garrick, that
he exclaimed, "The young man will be flattered, and
ruined; for there will be no competitor that can
excite his emulation." His prophecy was in part
fulfilled; for though Garrick had many competitors,
he had no equal. In the course of his theatrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
career he had frequent attacks, but they were generally
foiled. One great source of his success was,
that Shakspeare's plays were at that time becoming
much more popular than they had been at any preceding
period. Let it be recorded to the honour of
our fair countrywomen, that this was in some degree
owing to several ladies of the first rank and most distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
taste, who had some years before formed
themselves into a society to support, by their presence
and encouragement, all the best plays of Shakspeare.
They were called the Shakspeare Club, and every week
ordered some favourite play of our divine bard; but
the feeble powers of the performers were not sufficient
to support the reviving taste of the public. The best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
among them thought that the whole art of playing
consisted in measured, pompous periods, and that an
approach to nature was a departure from eloquence.
The pellucid stream of Avon was congealed by the
coldness of their declamation, and the beams of
Shakspeare enveloped in the vapour of their mock-heroic
recitative. Until the appearance of this our
Newton of the theatre, the drama was under a dense
cloud: "he came, and all was light."</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick's profession was not adopted from
necessity, but choice; and to him the profession is
very materially obliged, for he has placed it in a
much more respectable point of view than it ever
had before.</p>

<p>His various powers as an actor, to those who have
seen him, it is unnecessary to describe; to those who
have not, it is impossible. His abilities as a writer
were not of the first order, but they were by no
means of the last. It has been remarked, that his
prologues and epilogues had generally some allusion
to eating: considered as local and temporary compositions,
they have merit; and his epigrams, which
usually turned upon some little circumstance of the
day, have point. They sometimes drew forth additional
flashes from his friends, and sometimes the
retort of those at whom they were aimed; as in the
following, addressed to the redoubted and eccentric
Doctor Hill:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p class="verse">Thy equal there scarce is;</p>
<p class="verse">Thy farces are physic,</p>
<p class="verse">Thy physic a farce is."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The two next were afterwards inserted in the public
prints, and said to be the productions of some of Mr.
Garrick's friends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Thou essence of dock, of valerian, and sage,</p>
<p class="verse">At once the disgrace and the pest of this age,</p>

<p class="verse4">Will never read his rhymes.</p>
<p class="verse16">&mdash;"<em>Another Junto.</em>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>This was too bad, and the Doctor sent the following
answer to one of the papers:&mdash;</p>

<p>Like his brethren of the sock and buskin, our
English Roscius was honoured with much attention
from the public prints. They gave us critical examinations
of his powers, and critical disquisitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
upon his defects; from an enumeration of which it
was proved, clearly proved, that he would never be a
good actor. The remarks of these ingenious gentlemen
were soon forgotten: the testimony of an applauding
public answered and refuted them. By way
of antidote to these poisons, it must be acknowledged
that Mr. Garrick's friends nearly surfeited the town
with injudicious praise. Their flattery was gross
enough to have disgusted any other man; but he had
been so accustomed to strong doses of panegyric, that
he could at last swallow them double distilled. I
have said that he was an actor by choice; I might
have added, that he was always an actor. Goldsmith's
lines in retaliation are a true portrait:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Of praise a mere glutton, he swallow'd what came,</p>
<p class="verse">And the puff of a dunce&mdash;he mistook it for fame;</p>
<p class="verse">Till his relish grown callous almost to disease,</p>
<p class="verse">Who pepper'd the highest was surest to please.</p>
<p class="verse">But let us be candid, and speak out our mind,</p>
<p class="verse">If dunces applauded, he paid them in kind:</p>
<p class="verse">Ye Kenricks, ye Kellys, ye Woodfalls so grave,</p>
<p class="verse">What a commerce was yours, while you got and you gave!</p>
<p class="verse">How did Grub Street re-echo the shouts that you rais'd,</p>
<p class="verse">While he was be-Roscius'd, and you were be-prais'd!</p>
<p class="verse">But peace to his spirit, wherever it flies,</p>
<p class="verse">To act as an angel, and mix with the skies," etc.</p>

<p>The ode to the memory of Shakspeare, which he
wrote and spoke at Stratford, with many weak lines,
has some that show strong marks of a fervid imagination
and vigorous mind. To instance the following:</p>

<p>Many of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprits</i> are related; the following
I never saw recorded. When he and Quin strutted
at the same theatre, and in the same play, the performance
ending, and the night being rainy, each of
them ordered a chair, and walked to the door of the
playhouse. To the mortification of Quin, Garrick's
chair came first: "Let me get into the chair," cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the surly veteran, "let me get into the chair, and put
little Davy into the lantern." "By all means," replied
Garrick, "I shall be happy to give Mr. Quin
light in anything."</p>

<p>The little tribute which Doctor Johnson has paid
to his memory is written from the heart: I cannot
resist transcribing it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At this man's (Mr. Walmsley's) table I enjoyed
many cheerful and instructive hours with companions
such as are not often to be found; with one who
has heightened, and who has gladdened life: with
Dr. James, whose skill in physic will be long remembered;
and with David Garrick, whom I hoped to
have gratified with this character of our common
friend. But what are the hopes of man! I am disappointed
by that stroke of death, which has eclipsed
the gaiety of nations, and impoverished the public
stock of harmless pleasure."&mdash;<cite>Life of Edmund Smith.</cite></p>

<p>Mr. Hogarth lived in habits of intimacy with David
Garrick, who being President of the Shakspeare
Club at the time of the Stratford Jubilee, our painter
made him a drawing of a chair, which was afterwards
wrought in mahogany. A medallion of Shakspeare,
carved by Hogarth from a piece of the Stratford
mulberry-tree, is suspended to the back of it.</p>

<p>The paintings of the "Harlot's Progress," and
"Strolling Players," produced little more than a
hundred guineas; but in such estimation are portraits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
that the original picture from which this print was
copied, in every point of view inferior, was purchased
by the late Mr. Duncombe, of Duncombe Park, Yorkshire,
at two hundred pounds! It still remains in his
family. The print, by Mr. Hogarth's permission, was
copied for a watch-paper.</p>

<h3>INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS.</h3>

<p class="xxs">&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_268.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">The following description of Mr. Hogarth's
design in these twelve plates is copied
from his own handwriting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Industry and Idleness exemplified in the conduct
of two fellow-'prentices; where the one by taking
good courses, and pursuing points for which he was
put apprentice, becomes a valuable man, and an ornament
to his country; the other, by giving way to
idleness, naturally falls into poverty, and ends fatally,
as is expressed in the last print. As the prints were
intended more for use than ornament, they were done
in a way that might bring them within the purchase
of those whom they might most concern; and lest
any print should be mistaken, the description of each
print is engraved at top."</p>

<p>Such is the professed intention of the artist, and
such his apology for the manner in which these plates
are engraved; for, as Mr. Walpole justly remarks,
they have more merit in their intention than execution.</p>

<p>As a contrast to an idle and vicious character, who
is brought to consequent misery and shame, his fellow-'prentice
is depicted moral, attentive, and industrious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and, by regular and natural gradations, attains the
highest dignities of the greatest city in Europe. This
is making the pencil an instrument in the cause of
virtue, holding up the mirror of morality and truth,
and showing the fair reward of industry and integrity
to be happiness, honour, and independence; and the
inevitable consequences of idleness and vice to be
poverty, misery, and shame.</p>

<p>The hint for contrasting these two very opposite
characters is taken from the old play of <cite>Eastward
Hoe</cite>, written by Ben Jonson, George Chapman, and
John Marston, printed for William Aspley, 1605, and
reprinted in Dodsley's collection. In this comedy,
Touchstone, a plain and honest old citizen and goldsmith,
has two apprentices, Golding and Quicksilver:
the former is a counterpart of Hogarth's Goodchild,
and the latter has many of the dispositions of Mr.
Thomas Idle. Touchstone, in a proverbial and formal
style, advises all who wish to become respectable,
and acquire independence, to conduct themselves on
the same principles that he had done, and by adherence
to which he had gained his fortune:</p>

<p>"I hired me a little shop, bought low, took small
profits, kept no debt book; garnished my shop (instead
of plate) with good, wholesome, thrifty sentences:
such as, 'Touchstone, keep thy shop, and thy
shop will keep thee;' 'Light gains make a heavy
purse;' 'It is good to be merry and wise,' etc. etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">'Seek not to go beyond your tether,</p>
<p class="verse">But cut your thong unto your leather;</p>
<p class="verse">So shall you thrive by little and little,</p>
<p class="verse">'Scape Tyburn, Counter, and the Spittal.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The prologue concludes with what may serve as
an explanatory apology for the prints as well as the
play:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Bear with our willing pains,&mdash;or dull or witty,</p>
<p class="verse">We only dedicate it to the City."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Golding marries Touchstone's favourite daughter;
and the old citizen, in the quaint style of that day,
wishes he may live to see him "one of the monuments
of the city, and reckoned among her worthies; to be
remembered the same day with Lady Ramsey and
grave Gresham, when the famous fable of Whittington
and his puss shall be forgotten, and thou and thy acts
become the posies for hospitals; when thy name shall
be written upon conduits, and thy deeds played i' thy
lifetime by the best company of actors, and be called
their 'Get-penny;' this I divine and prophesy."</p>

<p>In the comedy, as in the prints, one of the scenes
is laid at Cuckold's Haven; young Golding becoming
a magistrate, Quicksilver is brought before him as a
criminal, etc. etc.</p>

<p class="noindent">At the time these twelve prints were published, the
business of a silk weaver was considered as much
more respectable and important than it has been since
the general fashion of wearing linen. The first view
we have of the two heroes of our history, is at the
looms of their master, an inhabitant of Spitalfields.
The assiduity of one of these young artisans is manifested
in his countenance, and attention to the business
he is engaged in. Over his head hang those two
excellent old ballads, <cite>Turn again, Whittington, Lord
Mayor of London</cite>, and <cite>The Valiant Apprentice</cite>. On
the floor near him is the <cite>'Prentice's Guide</cite>, a book
which our citizen probably presented to every young
man he had under his care; for we see the same title
on a mutilated volume at the feet of Mr. Thomas
Idle, who, being asleep, has dropped his shuttle, which
a cat is playing with. On the wall hangs the ballad
of <cite>Moll Flanders</cite>, and very near him is a tobacco-pipe<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
and a porter pot; the somniferous qualities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
these two narcotics have perhaps contributed to close
his eyes. His appearance is consonant to his disposition;
hair uncombed, collar unbuttoned, and worn-out
coat, are strong indications of negligence and
sloth. With angry eye, and cane lifted up, the master,
just entering the room, seems very well disposed to
punish his indolence and drowsiness; but these habits
are too strongly rooted to be eradicated by chastisement.</p>

<p>Thus far is admirably thought, and intelligibly
depicted; but the delineation, as far as regards the
picturesque effect, is beneath criticism. The head of
Master Francis Goodchild, placed between two square
posts, looks as if it were stuck in the pillory; the
physiognomy of Mister Thomas Idle is correctly
correspondent with his depraved character; but the
introduction of such a number of angles and parallel
lines as the scene demanded, the artist's eye could
never have borne upon any other principle than that
given in his introductory declaration, "that the prints
were intended for use more than ornament."</p>

<p class="noindent">This plate displays our industrious young man
attending divine service, in the same pew with his
master's daughter, where he shows every mark of
decent and devout attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Hogarth's strong bias to burlesque was not
to be checked by time or place. It is not easy to
imagine anything more whimsically grotesque than
the female Falstaff. A fellow near her, emulating the
deep-toned organ, and the man beneath, who, though
asleep, joins his sonorous tones in melodious chorus
with the admirers of those two pre-eminent poets,
Hopkins and Sternhold. The pew-opener is a very
prominent and principal figure; two old women adjoining
Miss West's seat are so much in shadow, that
we are apt to overlook them: they are, however, all
three making the dome ring with their exertions.</p>

<p>The preacher, reader, and clerk, with many of the
small figures in the gallery and beneath, are truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
ludicrous; and we regret their being on so reduced a
scale, that they are scarce perceptible to the naked
eye. It was necessary that the artist should exhibit
a crowded congregation, but it must be acknowledged
he has neglected the rules of perspective. The print
wants depth. In the countenance of Miss West and
her lover there is a resemblance. Their faces have
not much expression, but this is atoned for by a
natural and pleasing simplicity. Character was not
necessary.</p>

<p class="noindent">While the industrious and sedate apprentice is engaged
in such exercises as mend the heart and improve
the understanding; while properly devoting
the seventh day to the praise of his Creator, he
attends divine service, returns thanks for the blessings
he enjoys, and prays for their continuance, an inmate
of the same house, about the same age, and of the
same rank in society, who might have participated
in all his advantages, is stretched upon a grave-stone
in the churchyard, and gambling with a group of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>mendicants. Their amusement seems to be the favourite
old English game of hustle-cap, and our idle
and unprincipled youth is endeavouring to cheat, by
concealing some of the halfpence under the broad
brim of his hat. This is perceived by the shoeblack,
and warmly resented by the fellow with the black
patch over his eye, who loudly insists on the hats
being fairly removed. The eager anxiety which marks
these mean gamblers is equal to that of two peers
playing for an estate. The latter could not have
more solicitude for the turn of a die which was to
determine who was the proprietor of ten thousand
acres, than is displayed in the countenance of Mr.
Thomas Idle. Their debate has been loud, and their
attention is so much engrossed, that they have not
heard the cautious steps of a beadle, who seems
likely to terminate the dispute by a smart stroke from
his rattan, which is aimed with apparent goodwill at
the back of our disciple of indolence. His three
associates are of the lowest order; among them is a
half-naked shoeblack. Like his companion, with one
hand lifted up to his head, he is disturbing part of
that clan who have been always distinguished for
their tenacious adherence to the slothful. The tombstone&mdash;inscribed,
"Here lies the body of"&mdash;applies
very well to the young gentleman who, in an attitude
highly expressive of idleness, is recumbent upon
it. Even the skulls, on the ground near the new-opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
grave, have character. These, with the other
mementos of mortality, are indiscriminately scattered
on the earth, and trampled upon by the most contemptible
survivors. "How rich, how honoured once,
avails them not."</p>

<p>The figures in this print are well grouped, and the
countenances of the gamblers and beadle admirably
marked.</p>

<p class="pfs70">THE INDUSTRIOUS 'PRENTICE A FAVOURITE, AND ENTRUSTED
BY HIS MASTER.</p>

<p class="noindent">From attention to business and propriety of conduct,
the industrious apprentice has gained the confidence
of his employer. He is now in the counting-house,
entrusted with the management of the business; has
the day-book, purse, and keys in his hands, and attentively
listens to the directions of his friendly master,
who, with a face expressive of the highest partiality
and regard, familiarly leans upon his shoulder. A
partnership, on the eve of taking place, is covertly
intimated by a pair of gloves upon the writing-desk.
The young merchant's sedulous application is well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>hinted at by an headpiece to the <cite>London Almanac</cite>,
"Industry taking time by the forelock." A city
porter, bringing in bales of goods, has a true
Bardolphian face. The mastiff that attends him is
violently opposed by the domestic cat, who, considering
this house as her own peculiar domain, and
having an hereditary dislike to the canine species,
endeavours to drive him from the premises. Neither
cat, dog, nor porter are well drawn, nor is much regard
paid to perspective; but the general design is
carried on by such easy and natural gradations, and
the consequent success of an attentive conduct displayed
in colours so plain and perspicuous, that little
errors in execution should be overlooked or forgiven.</p>

company, the idle apprentice, having forfeited the
regard and tired the patience of his master, is sent to
sea, in the hope that a separation from his associates,
joined to the inevitable hardships of a maritime life,
may in some degree reclaim him. He is exhibited in
the ship's boat, accompanied by his afflicted mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
whose dress intimates that she is a widow, and who
had naturally formed hopes of this boy's being a comfort
to her old age. The waterman, with a significant
face, points to a figure on a gibbet, advising him to
look at it as emblematical of his future fate. A boy
shows him a cat-o'-nine tails as a specimen of the discipline
on board a ship; this <em>water-wit</em> the abandoned
young man returns by holding up two fingers in the
form of horns, and recommending this Joe Miller of
the Thames to look at Cuckold's Point, which is in
the distance. Having forfeited his indentures, he has
thrown them into the river, is totally lost to reflection,
and insensible to the grief of his mother, the ridicule
of his companions, or his own unhappy situation.</p>

bed, it seems evident that the source of his present
subsistence is from robbery on the highway. Horror
and dismay are strongly depicted in his agitated and
terrified face.&mdash;What a contrast to the serenity displayed
in the countenance of his fellow-'prentice!
To prevent surprise, the door is locked, double bolted,
and barricaded with planks from the floor; notwithstanding
these precautions, the noise occasioned by a
cat having slipped down a ruinous chimney, throws
him into the utmost terror. Not so his depraved
companion; solely engrossed by the plunder upon the
bed,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> she looks with delighted eyes at a glittering
earring. The broken jug, pipe, knife, plate, dram-bottle,
glass, and pistols, are very properly introduced;
and the rat, who makes a precipitate retreat, instinctively
conscious that its natural enemy is near, renders
this filthy and disgusting scene still more nauseous.
The lady's hoop is a good specimen of the fashion of
that day, when this cumbrous, inconvenient, and ungraceful
combination of whales' bones was worn by
women of the lowest as well as the highest rank.</p>

<p class="noindent">From industry become opulent, from integrity and
punctuality respectable, our young merchant is now
Sheriff of London, and dining with the different
companies in Guildhall. A group on the left side
are admirably characteristic; their whole souls seem
absorbed in the pleasures of the table. A divine,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
true to his cloth, swallows his soup with the highest
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goût</i>. Not less gratified is the gentleman palating a
glass of wine. The man in a black wig is a positive
representative of famine; and the portly and oily
citizen, with a napkin tucked in his button-hole,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> has
evidently burnt his mouth by extreme eagerness.</p>

<p>The backs of those in the distance, behung with
bags, major perukes, pinners, etc., are most laughably
ludicrous. Every person present is so attentive to
business, that one may fairly conclude "they live to
eat, rather than eat to live."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>But though this must be admitted to be the case
with this party here exhibited, the following recent
instance of city temperance proves that there are now
some exceptions:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs, Aldermen, Chamberlain,
etc. of the city of London were once seated
round the table at a public and splendid dinner at
Guildhall, Mr. Chamberlain Wilkes lisped out, "Mr.
Alderman B&mdash;ll, shall I help you to a plate of turtle
or a slice of the haunch,&mdash;I am within reach of both,
sir?" "Neither one nor t'other, I thank you, sir," replied
the Alderman; "I think I shall dine on the beans
and bacon which are at this end of the table." "Mr.
Alderman A&mdash;&mdash;n," continued the Chamberlain,
"which would you choose, sir?" "Sir, I will not
trouble you for either, for I believe I shall follow the
example of my Brother B&mdash;ll, and dine on beans and
bacon," was the reply. On this second refusal the
old Chamberlain rose from his seat, and with every
mark of astonishment in his countenance, curled up
the corners of his mouth, cast his eyes round the
table, and in a voice as loud and articulate as he was
able, called "Silence!" which being obtained, he thus
addressed the prætorian magistrate, who sat in the
chair: "My Lord Mayor, the wicked have accused
us of intemperance, and branded us with the imputation
of gluttony. That they may be put to open
shame, and their profane tongues be from this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
utterly silenced, I humbly move that your lordship
command the proper officer to record in our annals,
that 'two Aldermen of the city of London prefer
beans and bacon to either turtle-soup or venison.'"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, there are men who, looking
on the dark side, and perhaps rendered splenetic,
and soured by not being invited to these sumptuous
entertainments, have affected to fear that their frequent
repetition would have a tendency to produce a
famine, or at least to check the increase, if not extirpate
the species of those birds, beasts, and fish with
which the tables of the rich are now so plentifully
supplied.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> But these half-reasoners do not take into
their calculation the number of gentlemen so laudably
associated for encouraging cattle being fed so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>fat that there is no lean left; or that more ancient
association, sanctioned and supported by severe Acts
of Parliament, for the preservation of the game.
From the exertions of these and similar societies, we
may reasonably hope there is no occasion to dread
any such calamity taking place; though the Guildhall
tables, often groaning under such hecatombs as are
recorded in the following account, may make a man
of weak nerves and strong digestion shake his head,
and shudder a little:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the 29th October 1727, when George <span class="fs80">II.</span> and
Queen Caroline honoured the city with their presence
at Guildhall, there were nineteen tables covered with
1075 dishes. The whole expense of this entertainment
to the city was £4889, 4s."</p>

<p>To return to the print! A self-sufficient and consequential
beadle, reading the direction of a letter to
Francis Goodchild, Esq., Sheriff of London, has all
the insolence of office. The important and overbearing
air of this dignified personage is well contrasted
by the humble simplicity of the straight-haired messenger
behind the bar. The gallery is well furnished
with musicians busily employed in their vocation.</p>

to the consequence of sloth. The idle and incorrigible
outcast, mature in vice, and lost to society, is
here represented in a night-cellar.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In this dreary
and horrid cavern of vice and infamy he is dividing
the spoil produced by robbery with one of his
wretched accomplices. The woman that seems his
favourite, and in whose garret we saw him in the
seventh plate, deliberately betrays him. The officers
of justice are entering, and he is on the point of being
seized. The corpse of a gentleman, who has been
murdered, is with unfeeling indifference put down a
cavity made in the floor for the purposes of concealment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>To show that the grenadiers company were
then, as now, a virtuous body of men, one of them, in
a true Dutch attitude, is smoking in the corner. A
scene of riot, likely to terminate in blood, passes in the
background. The countenances of the combatants,
and a noseless woman bringing the porter, are finely
marked. A rope, hanging immediately over a fellow
who is asleep, should not be overlooked. The
watches, which are in a hat, exhibit another instance
of Hogarth's peculiar accuracy; each of them is a
little after ten. Some cards scattered on the floor
show the amusements of this earthly Pandemonium.</p>

alderman and a magistrate; his depraved and atrocious
contrast, who was once his fellow-'prentice,
and the last plate exhibited in a night-cellar, is
now brought handcuffed before him, and accused of
robbery, aggravated by murder. Shocked at seeing
the companion of his youth in so degraded a situa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>tion,
he instinctively covers his eyes. Agitated,

<p class="noindent">After a life of sloth, wretchedness, and vice, the
career of our degraded character terminates at
Tyburn. His pale and ghastly look denotes the remorse
and horror of his mind; and it must embitter
his last moments to hear a Grub Street orator proclaim
his dying speech. The ordinary of Newgate
leads the procession, but the criminal's spiritual concerns
are left to an enthusiastic follower of John
Wesley, who zealously exhorts him to repentance.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
On the right side of the print we see his afflicted
mother: her coming to view this dreadful spectacle
does not seem consonant to strict propriety, but there
have been similar examples. In a cart above her is
a curious trio of females; an old beldam, who might
have been Sam. Foote's model for Mother Cole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
breathing out a pious ejaculation, and swallowing a
bumper of spirits at the same moment; a young
woman taking a glass from beneath, and a third dissuading
a fellow from ascending the vehicle. While
a vendor of gingerbread<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> expatiates on the excellence
of his delicious cakes, a minor pickpocket purloins
his handkerchief. A female grimalkin, enraged at a
man oversetting her orange-barrow, is literally tearing
his eyes out. To show the reverence which an English
mob have for anything that bears the appearance
of religion, and the effects which this exhibition has
upon their minds, an inmate of St. Giles' seizes a dog
by the tail, and is on the point of throwing it at the
Methodist parson. A female pugilist, near the centre
of the print, is so earnest in punishing a fellow who
has offended her, that she neglects her child, which,
lying on the ground, is probably destined to be
crushed to death. A tall butcher has suspended an
old legal periwig on the end of his cudgel: in this,
the artist might intend to display an emblem of the
sanguinary complexion which marks our courts of
justice.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The porter, with his pipe; a cripple; the
soldier sunk knee-deep in a bog, and two boys laughing
at him, are well imagined. Among the figures in

emphatically called the "Finisher of the law," who
sedately smokes his best Virginia upon the gallows.</p>

<p>A carrier pigeon is despatched at the time the
criminal arrives at Tyburn.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Two initials on the
coffin, not having been reversed from the original
drawing, are wrong in the print; I.&nbsp;T. instead of T.&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>In the background we have a view of Highgate
and Hampstead hills.</p>

<p>The arch look of a young pickpocket, the savage
ferocity of a woman tearing a fellow's face, and the
yell of another crying the dying speech, are admirably
expressed. Many of the smaller figures are
full fraught with character; for the grouping, let us
hear Mr. Gilpin, with whom I entirely agree:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We seldom see a crowd more beautifully managed
than in this print. If the sheriff's officers had not
been placed in a line, and had been brought a little
lower in the picture, so as to have formed a pyramid
with the cart, the composition had been unexceptionable."&mdash;<cite>Gilpin's
Essay.</cite></p>

<p>Two skeletons hanging on the outside of the frame
are emblematical; the body of a murderer being
usually consigned to Surgeon's Hall.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The trophies, composed of fetters, whips, and
halters, with the swords, maces, gold chains, etc., with
which the framework of the preceding prints are
decorated, must be admitted to be beneath the dignity
of historical painting; but considered as addressed
to young persons, and exhibiting a view of the different
consequences of industry and sloth, are strictly
proper.</p>

<p>The scene is laid at the east side of St. Paul's
Church, just turning into Cheapside; and in particular
honour of this day, the artist has introduced the late
Prince and Princess of Wales at a balcony, in view of
the pageant. A group on the scaffolding beneath is
formed of the most comic characters. Who can
abstain from laughter at the city militia, which are
below? They were at that time composed of undisciplined
men, of all ages and descriptions; young,
old, tall, short, crooked, straight, fat, and lean, made
up the motley band.</p>

<p>The man in a grenadier's cap, with a pot of porter
in his left hand, might perform the part of Sir
Tunbelly Clumsy.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> A neighbouring gentleman, in
a cut wig, is scarcely able to support his firelock.
The fellow firing off his musket exclaims, "Who's
afraid?" The next may be a very great man,
though nature has treated his exterior, as she did
that of our third Richard, rather unkindly, by
placing an envious mountain on his back. The
hero in a bag-wig, resting upon his arms, is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
from a splinter of the monument; "his dimensions
to any thick sight are invisible." Far different
is the strong-built man of war at his left hand:
by his <em>back front</em> he seems to have grown out at
the sides; what nature denied in height, she has
abundantly made up in breadth. His long sword
is so placed as to give the idea of a bluebottle
impaled on a pin. A plank, supported by a tub
and stool, having given way, two of the fair sex
fall to the ground. The most obtrusive figure in his
lordship's coach is Mr. Swordbearer, in a cap like a
reversed saucepan, which this great officer wears on
these grand occasions. The company of journeymen
butchers, with their marrow-bones and cleavers, appear
to be the most active, and are infinitely the most
noisy of any who grace this solemnity.</p>

<p>Near the left corner, a blind man, conscious that
he has but a poor chance in a crowd, endeavours
to preserve his hat and wig from the depredating
multitude. The Bunhill Fields trooper, who leans
against a post, with one of his bandeliers in his left
hand, has made a little mistake. A young man
in the booth above, not having the fear of dignity
before his eyes, is eagerly kissing a girl: the lady,
irritated at this indecorum, seems likely to leave
marks of her talons upon his forehead. At the
opposite corner, a vendor of the Grub Street classics
proclaims "a full, true, and particular account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the ghost of Thomas Idle, which appeared to the
Lord Mayor."</p>

<p>Numberless spectators, upon every house, and at
every window, dart their desiring eyes on the procession.
Of the figures on a tapestry, hanging from
a balcony<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> at the King's Head, I cannot discover the
meaning. Two flags beneath are blazoned with the
arms of the Stationers' Company; and that in a stand
which exhibits the ardent salutation before mentioned,
belongs to the pinners and needlers. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornucopiæ</i>
on the outside of the frame are symbolical of
that abundance which fills the hands of the diligent.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">The thought on which this whimsical and
highly characteristic print is founded,
originated in Calais, to which place Mr.
Hogarth, accompanied by some of his friends, made
an excursion in the year 1747.</p>

<p>Extreme partiality for his native country was the
leading trait of his character; he seems to have begun
his three hours' voyage with a firm determination
to be displeased at everything he saw out of Old
England. For a meagre powdered figure, hung with
tatters, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à-la-mode de Paris</i>, to affect the airs of a coxcomb
and the importance of a sovereign, is ridiculous
enough; but if it makes a man happy, why should he
be laughed at? It must blunt the edge of ridicule
to see natural hilarity defy depression; and a whole
nation laugh, sing, and dance under burdens that
would nearly break the firm-knit sinews of a Briton.
Such was the picture of France at that period, but it
was a picture which our English satirist could not
contemplate with common patience. The swarms of
grotesque figures who paraded the streets excited his
indignation, and drew forth a torrent of coarse abusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
ridicule not much to the honour of his liberality. He
compared them to Callot's Beggars, Lazarus on the
painted cloth, the Prodigal Son, or any other object
descriptive of extreme contempt. Against giving
way to these effusions of national spleen in the open
street he was frequently cautioned, but advice had no
effect; he treated admonition with scorn, and considered
his monitor unworthy the name of Englishman.
These satirical ebullitions were at length
checked. Ignorant of the customs of France, and
considering the gate of Calais merely as a piece of
ancient architecture, he began to make a sketch.
This was soon observed; he was seized as a spy, who
intended to draw a plan of the fortification, and
escorted by a file of musqueteers to M. la Commandant.
His sketch-book was examined leaf by leaf,
and found to contain drawings that had not the most
distant relation to tactics. Notwithstanding this
favourable circumstance, the Governor with great
politeness assured him, that had not a treaty between
the nations been actually signed, he should have been
"under the disagreeable necessity of hanging him
upon the ramparts:" as it was, he must be permitted
the privilege of providing him a few military attendants,
who should do themselves the honour of waiting
upon him while he resided in the dominions of the
Grande Monarque. Two sentinels were then ordered
to escort him to his hotel, from whence they conducted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>him to the vessel; nor did they quit their
prisoner until he was a league from shore, when,
seizing him by the shoulders, and spinning him round
upon the deck, they said he was now at liberty to
pursue his voyage without further molestation.</p>

<p>So mortifying an adventure he did not like to hear
recited, but has in this print recorded the circumstance
which led to it. In one corner he has given a portrait

<p>The French sentinel is so situated as to give some
idea of a figure hanging in chains: his ragged shirt
is trimmed with a pair of paper ruffles, on which is
written "Grand Monarch. P." The old woman,
and a fish which she is pointing at, have a striking
resemblance. The abundance of parsnips and other
vegetables indicate what are the leading articles in a
Lenten feast.</p>

<p>Mr. Pine the painter sat for the friar, and from
thence acquired the title of Father Pine. This distinction
did not flatter him, and he frequently requested
that the countenance might be altered, but
the artist peremptorily refused.</p>

<p>Part of the print was engraved by C. Mosley, but
the heads are evidently by Hogarth.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>A copy has been repeatedly engraven as an head-piece
to the cantata before mentioned: the profile of
the artist was traced for a watch-paper; and a wooden
representation of the starved soldier has frequently
decorated advertisements for recruits, where it is
opposed to the figure of a well-fed gourmand, characteristically
christened a valiant British soldier.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>
<p>The original picture is in the possession of Lord
Charlemont.</p>

<p>Soon after this painting was finished, a nail was
by some accident run through the cross at the top
of the gate. Hogarth strove in vain to repair the
blemish with paint of the same colour; he therefore
introduced a half-starved crow looking down on the
beef, and thus completely covered the defect.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">Among the writers of English novels, Henry
Fielding holds the first rank. He was the
novelist of nature, and has described some
scenes which bear a strong resemblance to that which
is here delineated. The artist, like the author, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
taken truth for his guide, and given such characters as
are familiar to all our minds. The scene is a country
inn yard, at the time passengers are getting into a
stage-coach, and an election procession passing in the
background. Nothing can be better described; we
become of the party.&mdash;The vulgar roar of our landlady
is no less apparent than the grave, insinuating, imposing
countenance of mine host. Boniface solemnly
protests that a bill he is presenting to an old gentleman
in a laced hat is extremely moderate. This does
not satisfy the paymaster, whose countenance shows
that he considers it as a palpable fraud, though the
Act against bribery, which he carries in his pocket,
designates him to be of a profession not very liable
to suffer imposition: they are in general "less sinned
against than sinning." An ancient lady getting into
the coach is, from her breadth, a very inconvenient
companion in such a vehicle; but to atone for her
rotundity, an old maid of a spare appearance, and in
a most grotesque habit, is advancing towards the
steps.</p>

<p>A portly gentleman, with a sword and cane in one
hand, is deaf to the entreaties of a poor little deformed
postilion, who solicits his customary fee. The old
woman smoking her short pipe in the basket, pays
very little attention to what is passing around her:
cheered by the fumes of her tube, she lets the vanities
of the world go their own way. Two passengers on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>the roof of the coach afford a good specimen of
French and English manners. Ben Block, of the
<em>Centurion</em>, surveys the subject of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Grande Monarque</i>
with ineffable contempt.</p>

<p>In the window are a very curious pair: one of them
blowing a French horn, and the other endeavouring,
but without effect, to smoke away a little sickness,
which he feels from the fumes of his last night's punch.
Beneath them is a traveller taking a tender farewell
of the chambermaid, who is not to be moved by the
clangour of the great bar-bell, or the more thundering
sound of her mistress's voice.</p>

<p>The background is crowded with a procession of
active citizens; they have chaired a figure with a horn-book,
a bib, and a rattle, intended to represent Child,
Lord Castlemain, afterwards Lord Tylney, who, in a
violent contest for the county of Essex, opposed Sir
Robert Abdy and Mr. Bramston. The horn-book,
bib, and rattle are evidently displayed as punningly
allusive to his name.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Under the sign of an angel, who seems dancing a
minuet on a cloud, is inscribed, "The Old Angle In
Toms Bates from London."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<p>Some pains have been taken to discover in what
part of Essex this scene is laid; but from the many
alterations made by rebuilding, removal, etc., it has
not been positively ascertained, though it is probably
Chelmsford.</p>

"Happy should I be to rescue from oblivion the name of auld Hogarth,
whose songs and quibbles have so often delighted my childhood! These
simple strains of this mountain Theocritus were fabricated while he
held the plough, or was leading his fuel from the hills. He was as
critical an observer of nature as his nephew, for the narrow field he had
to view her in: not an incident or an absurdity in the neighbourhood
escaped him. If any one was hardy enough to break through any
decorum of old and established repute; if any one attempted to overreach
his neighbour, or cast a leering eye at his wife, he was sure to
hear himself sung over the whole parish, nay, to the very boundaries
of the Westmoreland dialect! so that his songs were said to have a
greater effect on the manners of his neighbourhood, than even the sermons
of the parson himself. But his poetical talents were not confined
to the incidents of his village; I myself have had the honour to bear a
part in one of his plays (I say <em>one</em>, for there are several of them extant
in <em>MS.</em> in the mountains of Westmoreland to this hour). The play was
called <cite>The Destruction of Troy</cite>; it was written in metre, much in the
manner of <cite>Lopez de Vega</cite>, or the ancient French drama. The unities
were not too strictly observed, for the siege of ten years was all represented:
every hero was in the piece, so that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> consisted
of every lad of genius in the whole parish. The wooden horse;&mdash;Hector
dragged by the heels;&mdash;the fury of Diomede;&mdash;the flight of
Æneas;&mdash;and the burning of the city, were all represented. I remember
not what fairies had to do in all this; but as I happened to be about
three feet high at the time of this still talked of exhibition, I personated
one of these tiny beings. The stage was a fabrication of boards, placed
about six feet high, on strong posts; the green-room was partitioned
off with the same materials; its ceiling was the azure canopy of heaven;
and the boxes, pit, and galleries, were laid into one by the great Author
of nature, for they were the green slope of a fine hill. Despise not,
reader, this humble state of the provincial drama: let me tell you, there
were more spectators, for three days together, than your three theatres
in London would hold; and let me add, still more to your confusion,
that you never saw an audience half so well pleased.
</p>
<p>
"The exhibition was begun with a grand procession from the village,
to a great stone (dropped by the Devil, about a quarter of a mile off,
when he tried in vain to erect a bridge across Windermere; so the
people, unlike the rest of the world, have remained a good sort of
people ever since),&mdash;I say, the procession was begun by the minstrels of
five parishes, and followed by a yeoman on bull-back. You stare&mdash;stop
then, till I inform you that this adept had so far civilised his bull,
that he would suffer the yeoman to mount his back, and even to play
upon the fiddle there. The managers besought him to join the procession;
but the bull not being accustomed to much company, and
particularly to so much applause,&mdash;whether he was intoxicated with
praise, thought himself affronted and made game of, or whether a
favourite cow came across his imagination, certain it was that he broke
out of the procession, erected his tail, and, like another <em>Europa</em>, carried
off the affrighted yeoman and his fiddle over hedge and ditch, till he
arrived at his own field. This accident rather inflamed than depressed
the good humour arising from the procession; and the clown, or Jack
Pudding of the piece, availed himself so well of the incident, that the
lungs and ribs of the spectators were in manifest danger. This character
was the most important personage in the whole play; for his
office was to turn the most serious parts of the drama into burlesque and
ridicule; he was a compound of Harlequin and the Merry-Andrew, or
rather the arch-fool of the ancient kings. His dress was a white jacket
covered with bulls, bears, birds, fish, etc., cut in various-coloured cloth;
his trousers were decorated in like manner, and hung round with small
bells; and his cap was that of folly, decorated with bells, and an otter's
brush impending. The lath sword must be of great antiquity in this
island, for it hath been the appendage of a Jack Pudding in the mountains
of Westmoreland time out of mind.
</p>
<p>
"The play was opened by this character, with a song, which answered
the double purpose of a play-bill and a prologue, for his duty gave
the audience a foretaste of the rueful incidents they were about to
behold; and it called out the actors one by one to make the spectators
acquainted with their names and characters, walking round and round,
till the whole <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> made one great circle on the stage.
The audience being thus become acquainted with the actors, the play
opened with Paris running away with Helen, and Menelaus scampering
after them. Then followed the death of Patroclus, the rage of
Achilles, the persuasions of Ulysses, etc. etc., and the whole was interlarded
with apt songs, both serious and comic, all the production of
auld Hogarth. The bard, however, at this time had been dead
some years, and I believe this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> was a jubilee to his memory:
but let it not detract from the memory of Mr. Garrick to say, that his
at Stratford was but a copy of one forty years ago on the banks of
Windermere. Was it any improvement, think you, to introduce several
bulls into the procession instead of one?&mdash;But I love not comparisons,
and so conclude.&mdash;Yours, etc.,

told that "<em>his apprenticeship was no sooner expired, than he entered into
the academy in St. Martin's Lane, and studied drawing from the life</em>."
In this circumstance, which is in itself trifling, I think the Right Honourable
author has not displayed his usual accuracy. Hogarth was
emancipated from his Cranbourn Alley confinement about the year 1718,
at which time, I believe, there was not an academy either in that or
any other part of London. The first for the use of students in drawing
was opened in 1724, by Sir James Thornhill, at his house in Covent
Garden. On his death, which was in May 1734, the casts, models,
benches, etc., were sent to Mr. Hogarth (who had four years before
married Miss Thornhill); by him they were afterwards lent to an
academy established at what had previously been <em>Roubiliac's workshop</em>,
in St. Martin's Lane.</p></div>

engraver, who told me that when very young, and on the point of
going to Paris for improvement in his profession, he took two plates
of small landscapes, which he had just finished, to Mr. Bowles, who
expressed himself much pleased with the performance of them, and
<em>generously</em> proffered him two pieces of plain copper, of the same size
and weight,&mdash;by practising on which, he might still further <em>improve</em>
himself. When I add, that one of the engravings delivered to this
<em>patron</em> was that very pretty little landscape inscribed <span class="smcap">Evening</span>, it is
scarcely necessary to say&mdash;the offer was rejected.</p></div>

"The <em>Hogarth mania</em> is as strong as ever. On Thursday the 6th
of April,&mdash;it should have been the first,&mdash;the Roman Military Punishments,
a paltry work for which no bookseller seven years ago would
have offered more than a few shillings, was sold at Greenwood's for six
pounds, on account of some trifling plates in it by Hogarth."
</p>
<p>
In the sale of Doctor Lort's library at Leigh and Sotheby's, in 1790,
a copy of Bever's book produced a still larger sum.</p></div>

<p>
From his shop-bill, and every preceding print, I am inclined to think
he never had more than <em>one mode</em> of spelling his name. The concluding

a failure of the aquafortis. His father's Latin letter, dated 1697, proves
that <em>he</em> inserted the final <em>h</em>, and I can discover no reason why his son

from the Accession of the Third George</cite>. The following extract proves
that painting pictures, <em>called after</em> the ancient masters, was not confined
to Italy: we had in England some industrious and laborious artists
who, like the unfortunate Chatterton, gave the honours of their best
performances to others. The narrative has no date, but some allusions
to a late sovereign determine it was a short time before we discovered
that there were in our own poets subjects as worthy of the pencil as
any found in the idle tales of antiquity, or the still more idle legends of
popery:&mdash;

<p>
"The late edict of the Emperor, for selling the pictures of which
he has despoiled the convents, will be a very fortunate circumstance for
many of the artists of this country, whose sole employment is <em>painting
old pictures</em>; and this will be a glorious opportunity for introducing
<em>modern antiques</em> into the cabinets of the curious.
</p>
<p>
"A most indefatigable dealer, apprehensive that there might be a
difficulty, and enormous expense in procuring from abroad a sufficient
quantity to gratify the eagerness of the English connoisseurs, has taken
the more economical method of having a number painted here. The
bill of one of his workmen, which came into my hands by an accident,
I think worth preservation, and have taken a copy for the information
of future ages. Every picture is at present most sacredly preserved
from the public eye, but in the course of a few months will be smoked
into antiquity, and may probably be announced in manner and form
following:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="p2 pfs80">"TO THE LOVERS OF VIRTU.</p>

<p>
"Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has the heartfelt pleasure of congratulating the amateurs of
the fine arts upon such an opportunity of enriching their collections, as
no period from the days of the divine Apelles to the present irradiated
era ever produced; nor is it probable that there ever will be in any
future age so splendid, superb, brilliant, and matchless an assemblage of
unrivalled pictures as he begs leave to announce to the connoisseurs are
now exhibiting at his great room in &mdash;&mdash;, being the principal part of that
<em>magnificent bouquet</em> which have been accumulating for so many ages,
been preserved with religious care, and contemplated with pious awe,
while they had an holy refuge in the peaceful gloom of the convents of
Germany. By the edict of the Emperor they are banished from these
consecrated walls, and are now emerged from obscurity with undiminished
lustre! with all their native charms, mellowed by the tender,
softening pencil of time, and introduced to this emporium of taste!
this favourite seat of the arts! this exhibition-room of the universe;
and when seen, must produce the most pleasing and delightful sensations.
</p>
<p>
"When it is added, that they were selected by that most judicious
and quick-sighted collector, Monsieur D., it will be unnecessary to say
more; for his penetrating eye and unerring judgment, his boundless
liberality and unremitting industry, have ensured him the protection
of a generous public, ever ready to patronize exertions made solely for
their gratification!

<p>The following piece, published in the St. James's Evening Post of June

</p>
<p>
"Every good-natured man and well-wisher to the Arts in England,
must feel a kind of resentment at a very indecent paragraph, in the
Daily Post of Thursday last, relating to the death of <em>M. de Morine</em>,
first painter to the French king, in which very unjust as well as cruel
reflections are cast on the noblest performance (in its way) that
England has to boast of,&mdash;I mean the work of the late Sir James
Thornhill, in Greenwich Hall. It has ever been the business of narrow,
little geniuses, who by a tedious application to minute parts have (as
they fancy) attained to a great insight into the correct drawing of a
figure, and have acquired just knowledge enough in the art to tell
accurately when a toe is too short or a finger too thick, to endeavour,
by detracting from the merits of great men, to build themselves a kind
of reputation. These peddling demi-critics, on the painful discovery of
some little inaccuracy (which proceeds mostly from the freedom of the
pencil), without any regard to the more noble parts of a performance
(which they are totally ignorant of), with great satisfaction condemn the
whole as a bad and incorrect piece.

"There is another set of gentry, more noxious to the art than these,
and those are your <em>picture-jobbers from abroad</em>, who are always ready
to raise a great cry in the prints, whenever they think their craft is
in danger; and indeed it is their interest to depreciate every English
work as hurtful to their trade of continually importing ship-loads of
<em>Dead Christs</em>, <em>Holy Families</em>, <em>Madonnas</em>, and other dismal dark subjects,
neither entertaining nor ornamental, on which they scrawl the terrible
cramp names of some <em>Italian</em> masters, and fix on us poor Englishmen
the character of <em>universal dupes</em>. If a man, naturally a judge of painting,
not bigoted to those empirics, should cast his eye on one of their
sham virtuoso pieces, he would be very apt to say: Mr. Bubbleman, that
grand <em>Venus</em>, as you are pleased to call it, has not beauty enough for
the character of an English cook-maid. Upon which the quack answers,
with a confident air: 'Sir, I find that you are no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">connoisseur</i>; the
picture, I assure you, is in Alesso Baldminetto's second and best manner,
boldly painted, and truly sublime: the contour gracious: the air
of the head in the high Greek taste; and a most divine idea it is.&mdash;Then
spitting in an obscure place, and rubbing it with a dirty handkerchief,
takes a skip to t'other end of the room, and screams out
in raptures, 'There's an amazing touch! A man should have this
picture a twelvemonth in his collection before he can discover half
its beauties!' The gentleman (though naturally a judge of what is
beautiful, yet ashamed to be out of the fashion, by judging for himself)
with this cant is struck dumb; gives a vast sum for the picture, very
modestly confesses he is indeed quite ignorant of painting, and bestows
a frame worth fifty pounds on a frightful thing, which, without the hard
name, is not worth so many farthings. Such impudence as is now
continually practised in the picture trade must meet with its proper
treatment, would gentlemen but venture to see with their own eyes.
Let but the comparison of pictures with nature be their only guide, and
let them judge as freely of painting as they do of poetry, they would
then take it for granted, that when a piece gives pleasure to none but
these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">connoisseurs</i>, or their adherents, if the purchase be a thousand
pounds, 'tis nine hundred and ninety-nine too dear; and were all our
grand collections stripped of such sort of trumpery, then, and not till
then, it would be worth an Englishman's while to try the strength of
his genius to supply their place, which now it were next to madness to
attempt, since there is nothing that has not travelled a thousand miles,
or has not been done a hundred years, but is looked upon as mean and
ungenteel furniture. What Mr. Pope in his last work says of poems,
may with much more propriety be applied to pictures:

"Sir James Thornhill, in a too modest compliance with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">connoisseurs</i>
of his time, called in the assistance of Mr. Andre, a foreigner,
famous for the fulness of his outline, to paint the Royal Family at the
upper end of Greenwich Hall, to the beauties or faults of which I have
nothing to say; but with regard to the ceiling, which is entirely of his
own hand, I am certain all unprejudiced persons, with (or without)
much insight into the mechanic parts of painting, are at the first view
struck with the most agreeable harmony and play of colours that ever
delighted the eye of a spectator. The composition is <em>altogether</em> extremely
grand, the groups finely disposed, the light and shade so contrived
as to throw the eye with pleasure on the principal figures, which
are drawn with great fire and judgment; the colouring of the flesh delicious,
the drapery great and well folded; and upon examination, the
allegory is found clear, well invented, and full of learning: in short, all
that is necessary to constitute a complete ceiling-piece is apparent in
that magnificent work. Thus much is in justice to that great English
artist.

<p>
"How hard a matter it is to withstand any natural instinct, and
habitual inclination whatsoever, the storie of the Syracusane Archimedes
(besides divers others to this purpose) may sufficiently persuade; who
was so rapt with the sweetness of his mathematical conclusions, that
even then when the enemie had entered the gates of the citie he was
found drawing of lines upon the sand, when perchance it had bin fitter
for a philosopher to have bin advising in the counsell-house.
</p>
<p>
"Not much unlike to whome I may peradventure seeme, who at this
time especially, when the unappeasable enimies of health, sicknesse,
and mortality have so mightily prevailed against us, am here found
drawing of <em>lines and lineaments, portraitures, and proportions</em>, when (in
regard of my place and profession) it might much better have beseemed
mee to have bin found in the colledge of physicians, learning and counselling
such remedies as might make for the common health; or if I
must needes be doing about <em>lines</em>, to have commented upon this proposition,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mors ultima linea rerum</i>.
</p>
<p>
"Howbeit, as I find not him much taxed in the storie for this his
diligent carelessness, because he was busied about matters which were
not onlie an ornament of peace, but also of good use in warre, so my hope
is (ingenious reader), that my sedulous trifling shall meete with thy friendliest
interpretation; insomuch as the arte I now deale in shall be proved
not onlie a grace to health, but also a contentment and recreation unto
sickeness, and a kind of preservative against death and mortality; by a
perpetual preserving of <em>their</em> shades, whose substances physicke could
not prolong, no, not for a season," <em>etc. etc.</em>

<p>
In his treatise of colours, he makes the following addresse to his faire
countrie wommen:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Having intreated of so many and divers thinges, I could not but
say something of such matters as <em>woemen</em> use ordinarilly in beautifying
and imbelishing their faces; a thing well worth the knowledge, insomuch
as many women are so possessed with a desire of helping their
complexions by some artificial meanes, that they will by no meanes be
diswaded from the same." He then enumerates ceruse, plume alume,
juice of lemons, oil of tartarie, camphire, and sundry other cosmetics
of the day, all which he takes many pages to prove are <em>enemies to health,
and hurtful to the complexion</em>, and thus adviseth: "Wherefore if there
bee no remedie, but women will be meddling with this arte of <em>pollishing</em>,
let them, instead of those mineral stuffes, use the remedies following.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Of such helpes of Beauty as may safely be used without danger.</em>
</p>
<p>
"There is nothing in the world which doth more beautifie and
adorne a woman than chearfulness, contentment, and good temper.
For it is not the red and white which giveth the gracious perfection
of beauty, but certaine sparkling notes and touches of amiable chearfulness
accompanying the same. The truth whereof may appear in a discontented
woman, otherwise exceeding faire, who atte that instant will
seem yll favoured and unloovely; as contrariwise, an hard-favoured
and browne woman, being merry, pleasaunte, and jocund, will seem
sufficient beautiful."</p></div>

of the former are more generally known; nor would we have it thought
that either of them has ever yet come up to the utmost beauty of nature.

In the frontispiece to Brook Taylor's perspective, he has given an example,

In his Analysis, Mr. Hogarth thus writeth:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The minuet is allowed by dancing-masters themselves to be the
perfection of all dancing. I once heard an eminent dancing-master say,
that the minuet had been the study of his whole life, and that he had
been indefatigable in the pursuit of its beauties, yet at last could only
say with Socrates, <em>he knew nothing</em>; adding, that I was happy in my
profession as a painter, in that some bounds might be set to the study
of it."</p></div>

"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Having been confined to my house by a violent cold,
I have had many hours for contemplation, which at such a time generally
turns on my friends, among whom you have been so good to
let me call you one. Your late kind intention came into my mind, and
gave me an uncommon degree of satisfaction; not on my own account
only, but with respect to my family. Your works I shall treasure up
as a family book, or rather as one of the classics, from which I shall
regularly instruct my children, just in the same manner as I should out
of Homer or Virgil. You will be read in your course,&mdash;and it will be
no unusual thing to find me in a morning in my great chair, with my
three bigger boys about me, construing the sixth chapter of the Harlot's
Progress, or comparing the two characters in the first book of the
'Prentices.
</p>
<p>
"You are one of the first great men I ever was acquainted with,
and the first great man I desire to be acquainted with, because you have
neither insolence nor vanity. Your character has been sketched in
different pieces, by different authors, and great encomiums bestowed on
you here and there in English, French, Latin, and Greek: but I want
to see a full portrait of you. I wish I were as intimate with you, and
as well qualified for the purpose, as your friend Fielding,&mdash;I would
undertake it. I have made an humble attempt here towards something,
but I am afraid it has more of a death's head than the face of a man.&mdash;You
won't be dispirited because my character of you is in the form of
an epitaph, for you will observe at the bottom that I have given you a
great length of days.

"He placed that picture, which in spite of all the critics could say
against it, had infinite merits in the view of the public, and at the same
time placed a man in an adjoining room to write down all objections
that each spectator made to it. Of these there were a thousand at least,
but Hogarth told the writer of this<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> that he attended only to one,
and that was made by a madman; and perceiving the objection was
founded, he altered it. The madman, after looking stedfastly on the
picture for some time, suddenly turned away, exclaiming,&mdash;<em>Hang it</em>, I
hate these white roses. The artist then, and not till then, observed
that the foldings of Sigismunda's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chemise</i> sleeves were too regular, and
had more the appearance of roses than of linen. I know not in whose
possession this picture now is, but I will venture to pronounce, that
nowhere can distress be more forcibly exprest on canvas: it is a distress,
not of the minute, but the day."</p></div>

extraordinary:&mdash;

<p>
" ... A word in favour of Sigismunda might have commanded

part of the Analysis which gave rise to them:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Notwithstanding the deep-rooted notion, even amongst the majority
of painters themselves, that Time is a great improver of good pictures,
I will undertake to show that nothing can be more absurd. Having
mentioned the whole effect of the oil, let us now see in what manner
Time operates on the colours themselves, in order to discover if any
changes in them can give a picture more union and harmony than has
been in the power of a skilful master with all his rules of art to do.
When colours change at all, it must be somewhat in the manner following;
for as they are made, some of metal, some of earth, some of stone,
and others of more perishable materials, Time cannot operate on them
otherwise than as by daily experience we find it doth, which is, that one
changes darker, another lighter, one quite to a different colour, whilst
another, as ultra-marine, will keep its natural brightness even in the
fire. <span class="smcap">Therefore</span>, how is it possible that such different materials, ever
variously changing (visibly, after a certain time), should accidentally
coincide with the artist's intention, and bring about the greater harmony
of the piece, when it is manifestly contrary to their nature; for do we
not see, in most collections, that much time disunites, untunes, blackens,
and by degrees destroys, even the best preserved pictures?
</p>
<p>
"But if, for argument's sake, we suppose that the colours were to
fall equally together, let us see what sort of advantage this would give
to any sort of composition: we will begin with a flower-piece. When a
master hath painted a rose, a lily, an african, a gentinnella, or violet,
with his best art and brightest colours, how far short do they fall of the
freshness and rich brilliancy of nature! And shall we wish to see them
fall still lower, more faint, sullied, and dirtied by the hand of Time,
and then admire them as having gained an additional beauty, and call
them mended and heightened, rather than fouled, and in a manner destroyed?
How absurd! instead of mellowed and softened, therefore,
always read yellow and sullied; for this is doing Time, the destroyer,
but common justice. Or shall we desire to see complexions, which in
life are often literally as brilliant as the flowers above mentioned, served
in the like ungrateful manner? In a landscape, will the water be more
transparent, or the sky shine with a greater lustre, when embrowned
and darkened by decay? Surely no.&mdash;These opinions have given rise to
another absurdity, viz. that <em>the colours now-a-days</em> do not stand so well
as formerly; whereas colours well prepared, in which there are but
little art or expense, have, and will always have, the same properties
in every age; and without accidents, damps, bad varnish, and the like
(being laid separate and pure), will stand and keep together for many
years in defiance of Time itself."</p></div>

were confined to his pencil. Having rarely been admitted into
polite circles, none of his sharp comers had been rubbed off, so that
he continued to the last a gross, uncultivated man. The slightest contradiction
transported him into rage. To be member of a club consisting
of mechanics, or those not many removes above them, seems
to have been the utmost of his social ambition; but even in these
assemblies he was oftener sent to <em>Coventry</em>, for misbehaviour, than any
other person who frequented them. He is said to have beheld the
rising eminence and popularity of Sir Joshua Reynolds with a degree
of envy; and, if I am not misinformed, spoke with asperity both of
him and his performances. Justice, however, obliges me to add that
our artist was liberal, hospitable, and the most punctual of paymasters;
so that, in spite of the emoluments his works had procured to him, he
left but an inconsiderable fortune to his widow."&mdash;<cite>Nichols' Anecdotes</cite>,

1688, justifies this supposition. In that year the annual amount of the

diocese, when the new church was built, gave orders that all the ancient
tablets should be placed as nearly as possible in their former situations.

It appears from an examination of the registers, etc., that Thos. Sice
and Thos. Horn were really churchwardens in the year 1725, when the
repairs were made. This print came out only ten years afterwards;
and the present state of the building seems to intimate that Messieurs
Sice and Horn had cheated the parish, when they officially superintended
the affairs of their church. The coat, shoes, and stockings of
the charity-boy convey a similar satire, though that is directed to
another quarter.</p></div>

as about Shakspeare's learning. One of these knotty points
Dr. Farmer's admirable pamphlet has put out of the reach of doubt,
the other is not of much consequence. I am afraid there are too many
damning proofs that Mr. William Hogarth was ignorant of spelling,
for his warmest admirers to contest the point any longer. His fame is
fixed upon a firmer basis. It was not necessary for him to study the
language of the schools; he searched into the grammar of nature, and
was himself the founder of an university, in which his pencil, usurping
the office of a pen, describes the passions as they affect the countenance,
and narrates the incidents that mark our little life with the minuteness
of a chronologist and the fidelity of an historian. It has been truly
said, that our divine poet saw nature "without the spectacles of books."
Our great artist could never have delineated the workings of the human
mind with that precise accuracy which marks all his works, if he had
studied the language of the passions from the books of your philosophy.</p></div>

violent a Whig, that the ceremony of Pope-burning, on the 17th of
November, was entrusted to his management. He wrote much in
defence of the party, and with the leaders was in high estimation.
Politicians and patriots were formed of much the same materials then
as they are now. Settle, being disappointed in some of his views, became
as violent a Tory as he had been a Whig, and actually entered himself
a trooper in King James's army at Hounslow Heath. The Revolution
destroyed all his prospects; and in the latter part of his life he was so
reduced as to attend a booth, which was kept by Mrs. Minns and her
daughter Mrs. Leigh, in Bartholomew Fair. From these people he
received a salary for writing drolls, which were generally approved.
In his old age he was obliged to appear in these wretched exhibitions;
and in the farce of <cite>St. George for England</cite>, performed the part of a
dragon, being enclosed in a case of green leather of his own invention.
To this circumstance Doctor Young refers in his Epistle to Pope:

by that turgid, inflated language so acceptable to an audience whose

In some of the provinces distant from the capital, their dramatic
exhibitions are still given out in the quaint style which marked the
productions of our ancestors. This sometimes excites the laughter of a
scholar, but it whets the curiosity of the rustic; and whatever helps to
fill a theatre or a barn, must be the best of all possible methods. From
the recent modes of announcing new plays at the two Royal Theatres,
there seems some reason to expect that the admirers of this kind of
writing will soon be gratified by having it introduced in the London
play-bills, or at least in the London papers, where hints of "the abundant
entertainment which is to be expected sometimes make their appearance
in the shape of 'a correspondent's opinion.'" But leaving
them to their admirers, let us return to humbler scenes, and give one
example out of the many which the provinces annually afford.

A play-bill, printed some years ago at Ludlow, in Shropshire, was
nearly as large as their principal painted scene, and dignified with letters
that were truly <span class="fs80">CAPITAL</span>, for each of those which composed the name
of a principal character were near a foot long. The play was for the
benefit of a very eminent female performer, the bill was said to be
written by herself, and thus was the evening's amusement announced:
</p>
<p>
"For the benefit of Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;. By particular desire of B&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash;,
Esquire, and his most amiable lady: This present evening will be
performed a deep tragedy, containing the doleful history of King Lear
and his three daughters; with the merry conceits of his Majesty's fool,
and the valorous exploits of General Edmund, the Duke of Glo'ster's
bastard.&mdash;All written by one William Shakspeare, a mighty great poet,
who was born in Warwickshire, and held horses for gentlemen at the
sign of the Red Bull, in Saint John's Street, near West Smithfield;
where was just such another playhouse as that to which we humbly
invite you, and hope for the good company of all friends round the

thought the term very happily applied, and pointedly appropriate to

White's gaming-house, and the Drury Lane patent, exhausted his
finances. Having exhibited himself as an unsuccessful actor and an
unfortunate manager, he in 1743 completed the climax by publishing a
poem entitled <cite>Dettingen</cite>, which proves him a very indifferent writer.
In 1744, he a second time appeared in the character of Lothario, for
the benefit of Mr. Horton, but seems to have had no requisites for the
stage. He was, however, a man of strict integrity and high honour,
and frequently suffered heavy losses rather than violate any engagement,
though it might be only verbal, which he had once made. Such a person
was very unfit for a coadjutor with men who were so busied in
qualifying themselves for personating the characters of others, that they
had no leisure for any attention to their own.</p></div>

character; for we are told that Mr. Highmore fixed upon Harper as
the person to take up for a vagabond, because he was naturally a very
great coward. One of the prints of the day, dated the 12th of November
1734, speaking of this transaction, concludes with the following
remark: "Sir Thomas Clarges and other justices have committed
Mr. Harper to Bridewell, in order to his being put to hard labour,&mdash;an
employment which, by his enormous bulk, he seems as little fit for as
he is for a vagrant; being a man so marvellously corpulent, that it is
not possible for him either to labour or to wander a great deal."
He was, however, a man of very fair character, and soon delivered from
his confinement by an order from the Court of King's Bench.</p></div>

found, carefully wrapped up in paper that had once been white, four
moderate-sized panes of glass, cut lozenge fashion. On the paper, in a
kind of law hand, was written what follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Theese curious peeces of antiquitie I did purchase from a glazyer
at Windsor, who informed me that he had them from his father, who
was in the same business, and lived for to be very old; and told unto
him, that while he was yet but a little scrubbed boy, being apprenticed,
his master did send him to put some newe paines of glasse in a cazement
at the Olde Kinges Armes in that towne; the old glasse being rendered
dimme and obscured, by wicked fellowes having at sundrie times
scribbled naughty and unseemly words and verses thereon. Upon the
enclosed paines were the fairest inscriptions; he therefore had kept
them, and recommended unto his sonne to doe the like. For a small
peece of gold they became mine, and I do beleeve were truelie written
by the handes of those verie menne whose names are put under each
verse, and that Falstaff his lines are meaned to convey a sort of sporting
resentmente against his old companion, once Prince Henrie,

him from his royal presence; though perhappes it may onlie meane to

following anecdote, which, not being noted by any of Dr. Johnson's
biographers, may as well have a place here:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
When the Doctor first became acquainted with David Mallet, they
once went with some other gentlemen to laugh away an hour at
Southwark Fair. At one of the booths where wild beasts were
exhibited to the wondering crowd, was a very large bear, which the
showman assured them was "cotched in the undiscovered desarts of
the remotest Russia." The bear was muzzled, and might therefore be
approached with safety, but to all the company except Johnson was
very surly and ill-tempered; of the philosopher he appeared extremely
fond, rubbed against him, and displayed every mark of awkward
partiality and subdued kindness. "How is it," said one of the company,
"that this savage animal is so attached to Mr. Johnson?"
"From a very natural cause," replied Mallet; "the bear is a Russian
philosopher, and he knows that Linnæus would have placed him in the
same class with the English moralist. They are <em>two</em> barbarous animals
of <em>one</em> species."
</p>
<p>
The Doctor disliked Mallet for his tendency to infidelity, and this
sarcasm turned that dislike into positive hatred. He never spoke to
him afterwards, but has gibbeted him in his octavo <cite>Dictionary</cite> under
the article <em>alias</em>.</p></div>

but I should suppose from the following circumstance, very soon afterwards.
This print was published in 1733, and on the 24th of June
1735 the Court of Aldermen came to a resolution touching Bartholomew
Fair, "that the same shall not exceed Bartholomew eve, Bartholomew
day, and the day after; and that during that time nothing but stalls
and booths shall be erected for the sale of goods, wares, and merchandizes,
and no acting be permitted."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_113_113" id="Footnote_113_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_113_113"><span class="label">[113]</span></a> A Mr. Banckes, who a few years afterwards published some rhymes
on this print, asserts, "that the performance at the booth, on the sign
of which is written, <cite>The Fall of Bajazet</cite>, is the droll of Fair Rosamond."
From the dresses, etc., I should imagine this ingenious gentleman is
wrong. He also observes, "that young Louis <span class="fs80">XV.</span>, King of France,
his queen, children, prime minister, etc., were this year exhibited in
Smithfield and the Borough at very reasonable prices, to spectators of
all degrees." Our artist, however, had forgot himself in regard to the
matter of which these great personages were made, the whole town
having been informed by their master of the ceremonies that they
were of a composition far exceeding wax. The same writer goes on to
inform us:

</div></div>

<p>
From the above lines, I should suppose that the late Mr. Pinchbeck,
with his wonderful and surprising piece of mechanism the Panopticon,
was at this fair; though he frequently spoke of one of his brothers,
"who," he said, "was a showman, and who once gave a very large sum
for an elephant, and took a room at Southwark Fair, with an intention of
exhibiting it; but the passage to this room," added he, "was so narrow,
that though my poor brother 'got the beast into it, a'never could get un
out on't; a' stuck in the middle on't and died!' So, sir, you sees my

not one Prayer-book. The wager was accepted, and a mock dispute
gave him occasion to ask for a Prayer-book to decide it. They had not
one.&mdash;He soon after privately offered to lay another wager with the same
gentleman, that among the ten parsons there was half a score corkscrews.
This also was accepted; and the butler being previously instructed,
coming into the room with a bottle of claret and a broken corkscrew,
requested any gentleman to lend him one. Every priest who was

<p>
"I never," says a person who knew little about the doctor, "saw

in the West Indies! My good sir, in <em>one</em> sentence there are <em>two</em> mistakes.
Ceylon is not one of <em>our</em> settlements, it belongs to the Dutch;
and it is situated, not in the West, but in the East Indies."
</p>
<p>

<p>
<em>Henley.</em> "More shame for you! I will engage to bring a boy of
eight years of age who will confute you."

Thus is a sale announced:&mdash;"Particulars and conditions of sale of that

meadow, pasture, and woodland, lying and being in an extensive vale,
whose surrounding acclivities are nobly clothed, and, rising in magnifique
form, exhibit luxuriant prospects of unequalled richness and
beauty.
</p>
<p>
"The pleasure-ground is comprised in a space of eleven acres, encompassed
with ha-ha! and grub walls. The elegant disposition of the
ground is beautifully improved with vistas, groves, and plantations,
through which walks wind in extensive circuit. Store-ponds and
elevated basons occupy the areas, regale those fragrant coverts, and
afford a constant and inexhaustible supply of water for the house, by
means of lead pipes, aqueducts, etc.

"Nature, propitious, hath luxuriantly featured the circumadjacent
grounds, and art hath been judiciously introduced to give richness and

through the vale, heightening the verdure of the divided pasture; and
the villages of Chigwell, Woodford, and Woodford Bridge, dawn
through that mass of prolific richness which fills the wide expanse."</p></div>

A reduced copy, with some variations, is placed as the headpiece of
an Epistle to Alexander Pope, Esq., by Mr. Banckes. One of the
variations is, a cobweb over the grate. If this good gentleman had
consulted his own headpiece, he would have recollected that, as even
a poet must sometimes eat, and the poor bard had no other room, or
grate, it was natural to think he must sometimes have a fire to dress his
scanty meal. In almost every other respect he is indeed a much more
unaccommodated man than was Stephen Duck when he was a thresher.
Duck, having made some rhymes, which for a thresher were deemed
extraordinary, was taken out of his barn, furnished with a stock in trade,
and set up as a poet. After that time he never wrote a stanza; his
Muse forsook him; he was haunted by the foul fiend, and hanged or
drowned himself, because Queen Caroline, who had made him a parson,
could not make him a bishop.

He was a native of Denbigh, in North Wales, and a citizen and
goldsmith of London. Though there were three Acts of Parliament
empowering the freemen of London to cut through lands, and bring a
river from any part of Middlesex or Hertfordshire, the project had
always been considered as impracticable, till Sir Hugh Middleton
undertook it. He made choice of two springs, one in the parish of
Amwell, in Hertfordshire, the other near Ware, each of them about
twenty miles from town. Having united their streams with immense
labour and expense, he conveyed them to London. This most arduous
and useful work was begun on the 20th of February 1608, and brought
into the reservoir, at Islington, on Michaelmas day, 1613. Like many
other projectors, he ruined his private fortune by his public spirit.
King James <span class="fs70">I.</span>, however, created him a baronet; and his descendants,
in lieu of a very considerable estate, had the honour of being called Sirs.
For the benefit of the poor members of the Goldsmiths' Company, he
left a share in his New River water; and his portrait is still preserved
in their hall.

The seventy-two shares into which this great liquid property was
divided, originally sold for one hundred pounds each, and for thirty
years afforded scarce any advantage to the proprietors. In the year
1780, shares were sold at nine and ten thousand pounds each; and
their price is increasing in proportion to the increase of the dividends,
by which their value is regulated.</p></div>

In its place, in the year 1678, was erected the animated equestrian
statue which now remains. It was cast in brass, in the year 1633, by
Le Sœur; I think by order of that munificent encourager of the arts,
Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel. The Parliament ordered it to be
sold, and broken to pieces; but John River, the brazier who purchased
it, having more taste than his employers, seeing, with the prophetic
eye of good sense, that the powers which were would not remain rulers
very long, dug a hole in his garden, in Holborn, and buried it unmutilated.
To prove his obedience to their order, he produced to his
masters several pieces of brass, which he told them were parts of the
statue. M. de Archenholtz adds further, that the brazier, with the true
spirit of trade, cast a great number of handles for knives and forks, and
offered them for sale, as composed of the brass which had formed the
statue. They were eagerly sought for, and purchased,&mdash;by the loyalists
from affection to their murdered monarch, by the other party as trophies
of the triumph of liberty over tyranny.</p></div>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;When I parted from you at Lincoln, I thought long before
now to have met with some oddities worth acquainting you with. It
is grown a fashion of late to write lives: I now, and for a long time,
have had leisure sufficient to undertake mine, but want materials for
the latter part of it; for my existence now cannot properly be called
living, but what the painters term <em>still life</em>, having ever since March 13th
been confined in this town gaol for a London debt. As the hunted deer
is always shunned by the happier herd, so am I deserted by the company,
my share taken off, and no support left me except what my wife
can spare out of hers:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">'Deserted, in my utmost need,</p>
<p class="verse">By those my former bounties fed.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>
"With an economy which till now I was ever a stranger to, I have
made a shift hitherto to victual my little garrison; but then it has been
by the assistance of some good friends; and, alas! my clothes furnish
me this week with my last resort; the next, I must atone for my errors
upon bread and water.
</p>
<p>
"Themistocles had many towns to furnish his tables, and a whole city
had the charge of his meals. In some respects I am like him, for I am
fed by the labours of a multitude. A wig has kept me two days; the
trimmings of a waistcoat as long; a ruffled shirt has paid my washer-woman;
a pair of velvet breeches discharged my lodgings; my coat I
swallow by degrees, the sleeves I breakfasted upon for three days, the
body, skirts, etc. served me as long; and two pair of pumps enabled
me to smoke several pipes. You would be surprised to think how my
appetite, barometer-like, rises in proportion as my necessities make their
terrible advances. I here could say something droll about a good
stomach, but it is ill jesting with edged tools, and I am sure that is the
sharpest thing about me.
</p>
<p>
"You may, perhaps, think I am lost to all sense of my condition,
that while I am thus wretched I should offer at ridicule; but, Sir, people
constitutioned like me, with a disproportionable levity of spirits, are
always most merry when most miserable, and quicken like the eyes of
the consumptive, which are brightest the nearer the patient approaches
his dissolution. But to show you that I am not lost to all reflection, I here
think myself poor enough to want a favour, and humble enough to ask
it. Then, Sir, I could draw an encomium on your good sense, humanity,
etc. etc.; but I will not pay so bad a compliment to your understanding
as to endeavour by a parade of phrases to win it over to my interest. If
at the concert you could make a gathering for me, it would be a means
of obtaining my liberty.

<p><a name="Footnote_154_154" id="Footnote_154_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154_154"><span class="label">[154]</span></a> The late Lord Orrery was a singularly formal character. Sir
Anthony Branville, in <cite>The Discovery</cite>, was intended for his portrait, and
exhibits a strong likeness. It was sometimes the wish of Mr. Garrick
to play upon the suavity of this old nobleman, and induce him to contradict
himself. This power he exerted very successfully on the following
occasion:&mdash;Lord Orrery wrote a letter from Ireland to Mr. Garrick,
requesting that Mossop might be engaged. The request of a man of
rank was, to the manager of Drury Lane, a command, and Mossop was
engaged. When, some months afterwards, the peer came to England,
he took an early opportunity of breakfasting with Mr. Garrick: the
moment he entered the room, he began his favourite subject.
</p>
<p>
<em>Orrery.</em> "David, I congratulate you: I inquire not about the success
of your theatre; with yourself and Mossop, it must be triumphant.
The Percy and the Douglas both in arms, have a right to be confident.
Separate, you were two bright luminaries; united, you are a constellation&mdash;the
<em>Gemini</em> of the theatric hemisphere. Excepting yourself, my
dear David, no man that ever trod on tragic ground has so forcibly
exhibited the various passions that agitate, and I may say agonize, the
human mind. He makes that broad stroke at the heart which, being
aimed by the hand of nature, reaches the prince or the peasant, the
peer or the plebeian. He is not the mere player of fashion; for the
player of fashion, David, may be compared to a man tossed in a
blanket: the very instant his supporters quit their hold of the coverlet,
down drops the hero of the day. However, as general assertions do
not carry conviction, I will arrange my opinions under different heads,
not doubting your assent to my declarations, which shall be founded
on facts, and built upon experience. First of the first,&mdash;his voice; his
voice is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox argentea</i> of the ancients, the silver tone, of which so
much has been written, but which never struck upon a modern ear till
Mossop spoke,&mdash;'then mute attention reigned.'"
</p>
<p>
<em>Garrick.</em> "Why, my Lord, as to his voice, I must acknowledge that
it is loud enough; the severest critic cannot accuse him of whispering
his part; for, egad, it was so sonorous, that the people had no occasion
to come into the theatre: they used to go to the pastrycook's shop in
Russel Court, and eat their custards, and hear him as well as if they
had been in the orchestra: '<em>he made the welkin echo to the sound</em>.' No
one could doubt the goodness of his lungs, or accuse him of sparing
them; but as to&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
<em>Orrery.</em> "What! you have found out that he roars! you have discovered
that he bellows!&mdash;Upon my soul, David, you are right; he
bellows like a bull. We used to call him 'Bull Mossop'&mdash;'Mossop
the Bull;'&mdash;we had no better name for him in the country. But then,
David, his eye is an eye of fire; and when he looks, he looks unutterable
things: it is scarce necessary that he should speak, for his eye
conveys everything that he means, and excepting your own, David, is
the brightest, most expressive, most speaking eye, that ever beamed in
a&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
<em>Garrick.</em> "Why, my Lord, with the utmost submission to your
Lordship, from whose accurate taste and comprehensive judgment I
tremble to differ,&mdash;does not your Lordship think there is a&mdash;a&mdash;a dull
kind of heaviness,&mdash;a blanket, a&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
<em>Orrery.</em> "What! you have discovered that he is blind?&mdash;Egad,
David, whatever his eye may be, nothing can escape yours. He is as
blind as a beetle. There is an opacity, a stare without sight, a sort of
filminess, exactly as you describe. But, notwithstanding I allow that
he bellows like a bull, and is blind as a beetle, his memory has such
peculiar tenacity, that whatever he once receives adheres to it like glue!
he does not forget a syllable of his part."
</p>
<p>
<em>Garrick.</em> "Upon my honour, my Lord, if his memory was what
you describe in Ireland, he must have forgot to bring it with him to
London; for here, the prompter is obliged to repeat every sentence,
and a whole sentence he cannot retain: there is absolutely a necessity
for splitting it into parts."
</p>
<p>
<em>Orrery.</em> "What! you have found that his head runs out. Upon my
soul, it never would hold anything: Lady Orrery used to call him
'Cullender Mossop'&mdash;Mossop the Cullender:' the fellow could not
remember a common distich. But, notwithstanding this, his carriage is
so easy, his air so gentleman-like, his deportment has so much fashion,
that you perceive at a glance he has kept the best company; and no
one who sees him conceives him a player. He looks like one of our
house: he has the port of nobility."
</p>
<p>
<em>Garrick.</em> "As to his port, my Lord, I grant you that the man is
tall, and upright enough; but with submission, the utmost submission
to your Lordship's better judgment, don't you think there is an
awkwardness, a rigid, vulgar, unbending sort of a&mdash;a&mdash;. We had
fencing masters, dancing masters, and drill sergeants, but all would not
do; he looked more like a tailor than a gentleman."
</p>
<p>
<em>Orrery.</em> "What! you think that he is stiff? By the Lord, David,
you are right,&mdash;nothing escapes you: he is stiff&mdash;stiff as a poker: we
used to call him 'Poker Mossop;'&mdash;we had no better name for him
in the country. But however his body might want (as I must acknowledge
it did) the graceful, easy bend of the Antinous, his mind was
formed of the most yielding and flexible materials: any advice which
you gave him, he would take; from you, I am persuaded, a hint was
sufficient."
</p>
<p>
<em>Garrick.</em> "Why, in this, my Lord, I must be bold enough to differ
from you in the most pointed and positive terms; for of all the obstinate,
headstrong, and unmanageable animals I ever dealt with, he is the most
stubborn, the most untractable, the most wrongheaded. I never knew
one instance where he followed my instructions in any the smallest
degree. If I recommend him to dress a character plain, he comes upon
the stage like a gingerbread king; if I advise him to be splendid in his
apparel, he endeavours to get a Quaker's habit from the keeper of our
wardrobe; and in everything, he&mdash;more than I thought belonged to
human nature&mdash;had that impenetrable, that&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
<em>Orrery.</em> "So!&mdash;you think him obstinate? Upon my soul he is&mdash;as
obstinate as a pig; he has more of that animal's pertinacity than any
man I ever knew in my life. But yet, David, with all these faults, he
is&mdash;I have not time to enter into particulars.&mdash;Be what he will, you
have engaged him? I sincerely wish you may agree together, and am,
my dear fellow, your most obedient. Say no more.&mdash;Farewell.&mdash;To
Mrs. Garrick present my compliments."</p></div>

the fields, with a grave face accosted him as follows: "How now,
Tom! smoking tobacco! pray who was your teacher? If you mean to

reputation which the book has thus obtained, and its very high interest as
illustrative of the manners, customs, and amusements of English life during the
half century following the Restoration, no apology is needed for placing such a work
more within the reach of general readers and students by re-issuing it for the first

the old edition could now be obtained.</em></div>

own century by</em> <span class="smcap">Theodore Hook</span>. <em>The sallies of his wit amused and delighted
three successive English sovereigns; and while his plays are forgotten, his songs
and ballads still retain the light</em> abandon <em>and joyous freshness that recommended
them to the wits and beaux of Queen Anne's days. Nor can the warm and affectionate
eulogy of Steele and Addison be forgotten, and</em> <span class="smcap">D'urfey</span> <em>may now take his

⁂ <em>Of the Poets of the Restoration, there are none whose works are more rare
than those of Sir John Mennis and Dr. James Smith. The small volume entitled
"Musarum Deliciæ; or, The Muses' Recreation," which contains the productions
of these two friends, was not accessible to Mr. Freeman when he compiled his
"Kentish Poets," and has since become so rare that it is only found in the cabinets
of the curious. A reprint of the "Musarum Deliciæ," together with several other
kindred pieces of the period, appeared in 1817, forming two volumes of Facetiæ,
edited by Mr. E. Dubois, author of "The Wreath," &amp;c. These volumes having in
turn become exceedingly scarce, the Publishers venture to put forth the present new
edition, in which, while nothing has been omitted, no pains have been spared to
render it more complete and elegant than any that has yet appeared. The type,
plates, and woodcuts of the originals have been accurately followed; the notes of
the Editor of 1817 are considerably augmented, and indexes have been added,
together with a portrait of Sir John Mennis, from a painting by Vandyke in Lord
Clarendon's Collection.</em></div>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to the end of the book text, and before
the publisher's Book Catalog. Some Footnotes are very long.</p>

<p>The 3-star asterism symbol in the Catalog is denoted by ⁂. <span class="handonly">On
some handheld devices it may display as a space.</span></p>

<p>To avoid duplication, the page numbering in the publisher's Book
Catalog at the back of the book has a suffix C added, so that for
example page [23] in the Catalog is denoted as [23C].</p>

<p>Footnotes <a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and
<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> are referenced from
the prior Footnotes <a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and <a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, not from the text itself.</p>

<p>For consistency and to follow the intent of the publisher, the PLATE
illustrations have been moved to the beginning of the section
describing them. In most cases this was only one or two paragraphs
earlier than the original book layout.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.  For example,
enniched; biasses; dismission; disquisitions; threadbare, thread-bare;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
